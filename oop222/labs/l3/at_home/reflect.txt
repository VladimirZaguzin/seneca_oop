1)	What happens to dynamic memory if it is not deallocated?

	We will get a memory leak, because OS would not be able to get access to allocated memory 
	

2)	What are the two methods of formatting IO stream data?

	we can use iomanip or functions from ostream.  iomanip is a manipulator; 
	we can use such command like - left, right to make a left or right justify,
	setprecision(), setfill(), setw() or flush
	in ostream we can use - precision(), width(), fill(), setf or unset to format output


3)	Why was dynamic memory required in the main() function of w3_in_lab.cpp to build the solution? 
	we did it to hold more then 1 set  of data

	
	1)to dynamically allocate memory based on number of days of weather	
	2) to delete it after we used programm
