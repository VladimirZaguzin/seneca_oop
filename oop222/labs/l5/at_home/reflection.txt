1. Explain how allocateAndCopy() function works in PhoneNumber.cpp



1)we check is data set valit or not by isValid fnction and return bool value true\false
2)if it is valid we set all this values into the object. also we dynamicly allocat memmory for a char array(_type)
3)as a return we will get true or false 

2. Explain why usually a copy constructor and assignment operator is 
needed when a class uses dynamic memory allocation to hold its resources




when we need to cope not a pointer but we want to copy wnat pinet points to.
standart method would not allow us to do it, we need a deep copy
