1)What is meant by a safe empty state?
safe empty state is a default value for an object to avoid a mistakes because of random value in memory

a. What is the safe empty state of the Enrollment class? Please describe in English words, not code.
we set all number valuse to 0 and all string to empty.this state is unrealistic for this object 

b. Is this a realistic empty state? Explain why or why not.
it's not a realistic empty state, we can't use year = 0 in real world, same as empty name and code name
2) Describe a case where having multiple Enrollment constructors would simplify the code of clients that use it.
when we need to create and fill up a lot of objects with repeating data, in this case such constructors would simplify the code
