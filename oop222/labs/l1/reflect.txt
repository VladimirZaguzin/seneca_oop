1) Dividing this solution into 2 modules allow us to modify each one separately. 
reduse the size of each module and make it ease to read. 
we will be able to use different prepared modules in future projects 

2)I used a man gcc as a source
-Wall -W means warnings, this option enables all warnings.
-o Place output in file file. If -o is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in a.out.
g++ -o prog1 prog1.cpp will give the out putt prog1.
