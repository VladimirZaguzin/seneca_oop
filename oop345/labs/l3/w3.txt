line 247-->
line 248-->by William Shakespeare
line 249-->
line 250-->
line 251-->
line 252-->                     1
line 253-->  From fairest creatures we desire increase,
line 254-->  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
line 255-->  But as the riper should by time decease,
line 256-->  His tender heir might bear his memory:
line 257-->  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
line 258-->  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
line 259-->  Making a famine where abundance lies,
line 260-->  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
line 261-->  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
line 262-->  And only herald to the gaudy spring,
line 263-->  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
line 264-->  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
line 265-->    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
line 266-->    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
line 267-->
line 268-->
line 269-->                     2
line 270-->  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
line 271-->  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
line 272-->  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
line 273-->  Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:  
line 274-->  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
line 275-->  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
line 276-->  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
line 277-->  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
line 278-->  How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
line 279-->  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
line 280-->  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
line 281-->  Proving his beauty by succession thine.
line 282-->    This were to be new made when thou art old,
line 283-->    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
line 284-->
line 285-->
line 286-->                     3
line 287-->  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
line 288-->  Now is the time that face should form another,
line 289-->  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
line 290-->  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
line 291-->  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
line 292-->  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
line 293-->  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
line 294-->  Of his self-love to stop posterity?  
line 295-->  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
line 296-->  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
line 297-->  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
line 298-->  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
line 299-->    But if thou live remembered not to be,
line 300-->    Die single and thine image dies with thee.
line 301-->
line 302-->
line 303-->                     4
line 304-->  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,
line 305-->  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
line 306-->  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
line 307-->  And being frank she lends to those are free:
line 308-->  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,
line 309-->  The bounteous largess given thee to give?
line 310-->  Profitless usurer why dost thou use
line 311-->  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
line 312-->  For having traffic with thy self alone,
line 313-->  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,
line 314-->  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
line 315-->  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?  
line 316-->    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
line 317-->    Which used lives th' executor to be.
line 318-->
line 319-->
line 320-->                     5
line 321-->  Those hours that with gentle work did frame
line 322-->  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
line 323-->  Will play the tyrants to the very same,
line 324-->  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
line 325-->  For never-resting time leads summer on
line 326-->  To hideous winter and confounds him there,
line 327-->  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
line 328-->  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
line 329-->  Then were not summer's distillation left
line 330-->  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
line 331-->  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
line 332-->  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
line 333-->    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,
line 334-->    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.
line 335-->
line 336-->
line 337-->                     6  
line 338-->  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
line 339-->  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
line 340-->  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,
line 341-->  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:
line 342-->  That use is not forbidden usury,
line 343-->  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
line 344-->  That's for thy self to breed another thee,
line 345-->  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,
line 346-->  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
line 347-->  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
line 348-->  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
line 349-->  Leaving thee living in posterity?
line 350-->    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,
line 351-->    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
line 352-->
line 353-->
line 354-->                     7
line 355-->  Lo in the orient when the gracious light
line 356-->  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
line 357-->  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
line 358-->  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,  
line 359-->  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
line 360-->  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
line 361-->  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
line 362-->  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
line 363-->  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,
line 364-->  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
line 365-->  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
line 366-->  From his low tract and look another way:
line 367-->    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:
line 368-->    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
line 369-->
line 370-->
line 371-->                     8
line 372-->  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
line 373-->  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
line 374-->  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
line 375-->  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
line 376-->  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
line 377-->  By unions married do offend thine ear,
line 378-->  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
line 379-->  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:  
line 380-->  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,
line 381-->  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
line 382-->  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
line 383-->  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
line 384-->    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
line 385-->    Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.
line 386-->
line 387-->
line 388-->                     9
line 389-->  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
line 390-->  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
line 391-->  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
line 392-->  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,
line 393-->  The world will be thy widow and still weep,
line 394-->  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
line 395-->  When every private widow well may keep,
line 396-->  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
line 397-->  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
line 398-->  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
line 399-->  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
line 400-->  And kept unused the user so destroys it:  
line 401-->    No love toward others in that bosom sits
line 402-->    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
line 403-->
line 404-->
line 405-->                     10
line 406-->  For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
line 407-->  Who for thy self art so unprovident.
line 408-->  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
line 409-->  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
line 410-->  For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,
line 411-->  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
line 412-->  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
line 413-->  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
line 414-->  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,
line 415-->  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
line 416-->  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,
line 417-->  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,
line 418-->    Make thee another self for love of me,
line 419-->    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
line 420-->
line 421-->
line 422-->                     11  
line 423-->  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,
line 424-->  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
line 425-->  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
line 426-->  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,
line 427-->  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
line 428-->  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,
line 429-->  If all were minded so, the times should cease,
line 430-->  And threescore year would make the world away:
line 431-->  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
line 432-->  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
line 433-->  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;
line 434-->  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
line 435-->    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
line 436-->    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
line 437-->
line 438-->
line 439-->                     12
line 440-->  When I do count the clock that tells the time,
line 441-->  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
line 442-->  When I behold the violet past prime,
line 443-->  And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:  
line 444-->  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
line 445-->  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
line 446-->  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
line 447-->  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:
line 448-->  Then of thy beauty do I question make
line 449-->  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
line 450-->  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
line 451-->  And die as fast as they see others grow,
line 452-->    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
line 453-->    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.
line 454-->
line 455-->
line 456-->                     13
line 457-->  O that you were your self, but love you are
line 458-->  No longer yours, than you your self here live,
line 459-->  Against this coming end you should prepare,
line 460-->  And your sweet semblance to some other give.
line 461-->  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
line 462-->  Find no determination, then you were
line 463-->  Your self again after your self's decease,
line 464-->  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.  
line 465-->  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
line 466-->  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
line 467-->  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
line 468-->  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
line 469-->    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,
line 470-->    You had a father, let your son say so.
line 471-->
line 472-->
line 473-->                     14
line 474-->  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,
line 475-->  And yet methinks I have astronomy,
line 476-->  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
line 477-->  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,
line 478-->  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
line 479-->  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
line 480-->  Or say with princes if it shall go well
line 481-->  By oft predict that I in heaven find.
line 482-->  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
line 483-->  And constant stars in them I read such art
line 484-->  As truth and beauty shall together thrive
line 485-->  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:  
line 486-->    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
line 487-->    Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
line 488-->
line 489-->
line 490-->                     15
line 491-->  When I consider every thing that grows
line 492-->  Holds in perfection but a little moment.
line 493-->  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
line 494-->  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.
line 495-->  When I perceive that men as plants increase,
line 496-->  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:
line 497-->  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
line 498-->  And wear their brave state out of memory.
line 499-->  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,
line 500-->  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
line 501-->  Where wasteful time debateth with decay
line 502-->  To change your day of youth to sullied night,
line 503-->    And all in war with Time for love of you,
line 504-->    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
line 505-->
line 506-->
line 507-->                     16  
line 508-->  But wherefore do not you a mightier way
line 509-->  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?
line 510-->  And fortify your self in your decay
line 511-->  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
line 512-->  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
line 513-->  And many maiden gardens yet unset,
line 514-->  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
line 515-->  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
line 516-->  So should the lines of life that life repair
line 517-->  Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen
line 518-->  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
line 519-->  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
line 520-->    To give away your self, keeps your self still,
line 521-->    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
line 522-->
line 523-->
line 524-->                     17
line 525-->  Who will believe my verse in time to come
line 526-->  If it were filled with your most high deserts?
line 527-->  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
line 528-->  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:  
line 529-->  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
line 530-->  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
line 531-->  The age to come would say this poet lies,
line 532-->  Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.
line 533-->  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
line 534-->  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
line 535-->  And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
line 536-->  And stretched metre of an antique song.
line 537-->    But were some child of yours alive that time,
line 538-->    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.
line 539-->
line 540-->
line 541-->                     18
line 542-->  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
line 543-->  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
line 544-->  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
line 545-->  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
line 546-->  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
line 547-->  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
line 548-->  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
line 549-->  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:  
line 550-->  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
line 551-->  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
line 552-->  Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
line 553-->  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
line 554-->    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
line 555-->    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
line 556-->
line 557-->
line 558-->                     19
line 559-->  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,
line 560-->  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
line 561-->  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
line 562-->  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
line 563-->  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,
line 564-->  And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
line 565-->  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
line 566-->  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,
line 567-->  O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
line 568-->  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,
line 569-->  Him in thy course untainted do allow,
line 570-->  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.  
line 571-->    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
line 572-->    My love shall in my verse ever live young.
line 573-->
line 574-->
line 575-->                     20
line 576-->  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
line 577-->  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,
line 578-->  A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
line 579-->  With shifting change as is false women's fashion,
line 580-->  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
line 581-->  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,
line 582-->  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
line 583-->  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
line 584-->  And for a woman wert thou first created,
line 585-->  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
line 586-->  And by addition me of thee defeated,
line 587-->  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
line 588-->    But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
line 589-->    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
line 590-->
line 591-->
line 592-->                     21  
line 593-->  So is it not with me as with that muse,
line 594-->  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
line 595-->  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
line 596-->  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
line 597-->  Making a couplement of proud compare
line 598-->  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
line 599-->  With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
line 600-->  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
line 601-->  O let me true in love but truly write,
line 602-->  And then believe me, my love is as fair,
line 603-->  As any mother's child, though not so bright
line 604-->  As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
line 605-->    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
line 606-->    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
line 607-->
line 608-->
line 609-->                     22
line 610-->  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
line 611-->  So long as youth and thou are of one date,
line 612-->  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
line 613-->  Then look I death my days should expiate.  
line 614-->  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
line 615-->  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
line 616-->  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,
line 617-->  How can I then be elder than thou art?
line 618-->  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,
line 619-->  As I not for my self, but for thee will,
line 620-->  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
line 621-->  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
line 622-->    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
line 623-->    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.
line 624-->
line 625-->
line 626-->                     23
line 627-->  As an unperfect actor on the stage,
line 628-->  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
line 629-->  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
line 630-->  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
line 631-->  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,
line 632-->  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
line 633-->  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
line 634-->  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:  
line 635-->  O let my looks be then the eloquence,
line 636-->  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
line 637-->  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
line 638-->  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
line 639-->    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,
line 640-->    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
line 641-->
line 642-->
line 643-->                     24
line 644-->  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
line 645-->  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,
line 646-->  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
line 647-->  And perspective it is best painter's art.
line 648-->  For through the painter must you see his skill,
line 649-->  To find where your true image pictured lies,
line 650-->  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
line 651-->  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:
line 652-->  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,
line 653-->  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
line 654-->  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
line 655-->  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;  
line 656-->    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
line 657-->    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
line 658-->
line 659-->
line 660-->                     25
line 661-->  Let those who are in favour with their stars,
line 662-->  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
line 663-->  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
line 664-->  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
line 665-->  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,
line 666-->  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
line 667-->  And in themselves their pride lies buried,
line 668-->  For at a frown they in their glory die.
line 669-->  The painful warrior famoused for fight,
line 670-->  After a thousand victories once foiled,
line 671-->  Is from the book of honour razed quite,
line 672-->  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
line 673-->    Then happy I that love and am beloved
line 674-->    Where I may not remove nor be removed.
line 675-->
line 676-->
line 677-->                     26  
line 678-->  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
line 679-->  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
line 680-->  To thee I send this written embassage
line 681-->  To witness duty, not to show my wit.
line 682-->  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
line 683-->  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;
line 684-->  But that I hope some good conceit of thine
line 685-->  In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:
line 686-->  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
line 687-->  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
line 688-->  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
line 689-->  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,
line 690-->    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
line 691-->    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
line 692-->
line 693-->
line 694-->                     27
line 695-->  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
line 696-->  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,
line 697-->  But then begins a journey in my head
line 698-->  To work my mind, when body's work's expired.  
line 699-->  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
line 700-->  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
line 701-->  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
line 702-->  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
line 703-->  Save that my soul's imaginary sight
line 704-->  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
line 705-->  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
line 706-->  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
line 707-->    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
line 708-->    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.
line 709-->
line 710-->
line 711-->                     28
line 712-->  How can I then return in happy plight
line 713-->  That am debarred the benefit of rest?
line 714-->  When day's oppression is not eased by night,
line 715-->  But day by night and night by day oppressed.
line 716-->  And each (though enemies to either's reign)
line 717-->  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
line 718-->  The one by toil, the other to complain
line 719-->  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.  
line 720-->  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,
line 721-->  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
line 722-->  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,
line 723-->  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
line 724-->    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
line 725-->    And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
line 726-->
line 727-->
line 728-->                     29
line 729-->  When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,
line 730-->  I all alone beweep my outcast state,
line 731-->  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
line 732-->  And look upon my self and curse my fate,
line 733-->  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
line 734-->  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
line 735-->  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
line 736-->  With what I most enjoy contented least,
line 737-->  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
line 738-->  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
line 739-->  (Like to the lark at break of day arising
line 740-->  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,  
line 741-->    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
line 742-->    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
line 743-->
line 744-->
line 745-->                     30
line 746-->  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
line 747-->  I summon up remembrance of things past,
line 748-->  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
line 749-->  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
line 750-->  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
line 751-->  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
line 752-->  And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
line 753-->  And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
line 754-->  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
line 755-->  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
line 756-->  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
line 757-->  Which I new pay as if not paid before.
line 758-->    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)
line 759-->    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
line 760-->
line 761-->
line 762-->                     31  
line 763-->  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
line 764-->  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
line 765-->  And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
line 766-->  And all those friends which I thought buried.
line 767-->  How many a holy and obsequious tear
line 768-->  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
line 769-->  As interest of the dead, which now appear,
line 770-->  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.
line 771-->  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
line 772-->  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
line 773-->  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
line 774-->  That due of many, now is thine alone.
line 775-->    Their images I loved, I view in thee,
line 776-->    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.
line 777-->
line 778-->
line 779-->                     32
line 780-->  If thou survive my well-contented day,
line 781-->  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
line 782-->  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
line 783-->  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:  
line 784-->  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
line 785-->  And though they be outstripped by every pen,
line 786-->  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
line 787-->  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
line 788-->  O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,
line 789-->  'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
line 790-->  A dearer birth than this his love had brought
line 791-->  To march in ranks of better equipage:
line 792-->    But since he died and poets better prove,
line 793-->    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.
line 794-->
line 795-->
line 796-->                     33
line 797-->  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,
line 798-->  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
line 799-->  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
line 800-->  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:
line 801-->  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
line 802-->  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
line 803-->  And from the forlorn world his visage hide
line 804-->  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:  
line 805-->  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
line 806-->  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,
line 807-->  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
line 808-->  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
line 809-->    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
line 810-->    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.
line 811-->
line 812-->
line 813-->                     34
line 814-->  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
line 815-->  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
line 816-->  To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
line 817-->  Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?
line 818-->  'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
line 819-->  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
line 820-->  For no man well of such a salve can speak,
line 821-->  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
line 822-->  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,
line 823-->  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,
line 824-->  Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
line 825-->  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.  
line 826-->    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
line 827-->    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
line 828-->
line 829-->
line 830-->                     35
line 831-->  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,
line 832-->  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
line 833-->  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
line 834-->  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
line 835-->  All men make faults, and even I in this,
line 836-->  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
line 837-->  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
line 838-->  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
line 839-->  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,
line 840-->  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,
line 841-->  And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
line 842-->  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
line 843-->    That I an accessary needs must be,
line 844-->    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
line 845-->
line 846-->
line 847-->                     36  
line 848-->  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
line 849-->  Although our undivided loves are one:
line 850-->  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
line 851-->  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
line 852-->  In our two loves there is but one respect,
line 853-->  Though in our lives a separable spite,
line 854-->  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
line 855-->  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
line 856-->  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
line 857-->  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
line 858-->  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
line 859-->  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
line 860-->    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
line 861-->    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
line 862-->
line 863-->
line 864-->                     37
line 865-->  As a decrepit father takes delight,
line 866-->  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
line 867-->  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite
line 868-->  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.  
line 869-->  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
line 870-->  Or any of these all, or all, or more
line 871-->  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
line 872-->  I make my love engrafted to this store:
line 873-->  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
line 874-->  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,
line 875-->  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,
line 876-->  And by a part of all thy glory live:
line 877-->    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,
line 878-->    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
line 879-->
line 880-->
line 881-->                     38
line 882-->  How can my muse want subject to invent
line 883-->  While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,
line 884-->  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,
line 885-->  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
line 886-->  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,
line 887-->  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,
line 888-->  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
line 889-->  When thou thy self dost give invention light?  
line 890-->  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
line 891-->  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,
line 892-->  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
line 893-->  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
line 894-->    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
line 895-->    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
line 896-->
line 897-->
line 898-->                     39
line 899-->  O how thy worth with manners may I sing,
line 900-->  When thou art all the better part of me?
line 901-->  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
line 902-->  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
line 903-->  Even for this, let us divided live,
line 904-->  And our dear love lose name of single one,
line 905-->  That by this separation I may give:
line 906-->  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:
line 907-->  O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,
line 908-->  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
line 909-->  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
line 910-->  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.  
line 911-->    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
line 912-->    By praising him here who doth hence remain.
line 913-->
line 914-->
line 915-->                     40
line 916-->  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
line 917-->  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
line 918-->  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
line 919-->  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
line 920-->  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
line 921-->  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,
line 922-->  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest
line 923-->  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.
line 924-->  I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
line 925-->  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
line 926-->  And yet love knows it is a greater grief
line 927-->  To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.
line 928-->    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
line 929-->    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
line 930-->
line 931-->
line 932-->                     41  
line 933-->  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
line 934-->  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
line 935-->  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
line 936-->  For still temptation follows where thou art.
line 937-->  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
line 938-->  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.
line 939-->  And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
line 940-->  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
line 941-->  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
line 942-->  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
line 943-->  Who lead thee in their riot even there
line 944-->  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
line 945-->    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
line 946-->    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.
line 947-->
line 948-->
line 949-->                     42
line 950-->  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
line 951-->  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
line 952-->  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
line 953-->  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
line 954-->  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,
line 955-->  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,
line 956-->  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
line 957-->  Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
line 958-->  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
line 959-->  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
line 960-->  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
line 961-->  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
line 962-->    But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,
line 963-->    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
line 964-->
line 965-->
line 966-->                     43
line 967-->  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,
line 968-->  For all the day they view things unrespected,
line 969-->  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
line 970-->  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
line 971-->  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
line 972-->  How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,
line 973-->  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
line 974-->  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!  
line 975-->  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,
line 976-->  By looking on thee in the living day,
line 977-->  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,
line 978-->  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
line 979-->    All days are nights to see till I see thee,
line 980-->    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
line 981-->
line 982-->
line 983-->                     44
line 984-->  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
line 985-->  Injurious distance should not stop my way,
line 986-->  For then despite of space I would be brought,
line 987-->  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,
line 988-->  No matter then although my foot did stand
line 989-->  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,
line 990-->  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
line 991-->  As soon as think the place where he would be.
line 992-->  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought
line 993-->  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
line 994-->  But that so much of earth and water wrought,
line 995-->  I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.  
line 996-->    Receiving nought by elements so slow,
line 997-->    But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
line 998-->
line 999-->
line 1000-->                     45
line 1001-->  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,
line 1002-->  Are both with thee, wherever I abide,
line 1003-->  The first my thought, the other my desire,
line 1004-->  These present-absent with swift motion slide.
line 1005-->  For when these quicker elements are gone
line 1006-->  In tender embassy of love to thee,
line 1007-->  My life being made of four, with two alone,
line 1008-->  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.
line 1009-->  Until life's composition be recured,
line 1010-->  By those swift messengers returned from thee,
line 1011-->  Who even but now come back again assured,
line 1012-->  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
line 1013-->    This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,
line 1014-->    I send them back again and straight grow sad.
line 1015-->
line 1016-->
line 1017-->                     46  
line 1018-->  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
line 1019-->  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,
line 1020-->  Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
line 1021-->  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,
line 1022-->  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
line 1023-->  (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)
line 1024-->  But the defendant doth that plea deny,
line 1025-->  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
line 1026-->  To side this title is impanelled
line 1027-->  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
line 1028-->  And by their verdict is determined
line 1029-->  The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part.
line 1030-->    As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part,
line 1031-->    And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.
line 1032-->
line 1033-->
line 1034-->                     47
line 1035-->  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
line 1036-->  And each doth good turns now unto the other,
line 1037-->  When that mine eye is famished for a look,
line 1038-->  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;  
line 1039-->  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
line 1040-->  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
line 1041-->  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
line 1042-->  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
line 1043-->  So either by thy picture or my love,
line 1044-->  Thy self away, art present still with me,
line 1045-->  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
line 1046-->  And I am still with them, and they with thee.
line 1047-->    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
line 1048-->    Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.
line 1049-->
line 1050-->
line 1051-->                     48
line 1052-->  How careful was I when I took my way,
line 1053-->  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
line 1054-->  That to my use it might unused stay
line 1055-->  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
line 1056-->  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
line 1057-->  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
line 1058-->  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
line 1059-->  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.  
line 1060-->  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
line 1061-->  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
line 1062-->  Within the gentle closure of my breast,
line 1063-->  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,
line 1064-->    And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
line 1065-->    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
line 1066-->
line 1067-->
line 1068-->                     49
line 1069-->  Against that time (if ever that time come)
line 1070-->  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
line 1071-->  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
line 1072-->  Called to that audit by advised respects,
line 1073-->  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
line 1074-->  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
line 1075-->  When love converted from the thing it was
line 1076-->  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
line 1077-->  Against that time do I ensconce me here
line 1078-->  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
line 1079-->  And this my hand, against my self uprear,
line 1080-->  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,  
line 1081-->    To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,
line 1082-->    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.
line 1083-->
line 1084-->
line 1085-->                     50
line 1086-->  How heavy do I journey on the way,
line 1087-->  When what I seek (my weary travel's end)
line 1088-->  Doth teach that case and that repose to say
line 1089-->  'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
line 1090-->  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
line 1091-->  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
line 1092-->  As if by some instinct the wretch did know
line 1093-->  His rider loved not speed being made from thee:
line 1094-->  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
line 1095-->  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
line 1096-->  Which heavily he answers with a groan,
line 1097-->  More sharp to me than spurring to his side,
line 1098-->    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
line 1099-->    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
line 1100-->
line 1101-->
line 1102-->                     51  
line 1103-->  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
line 1104-->  Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,
line 1105-->  From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
line 1106-->  Till I return of posting is no need.
line 1107-->  O what excuse will my poor beast then find,
line 1108-->  When swift extremity can seem but slow?
line 1109-->  Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,
line 1110-->  In winged speed no motion shall I know,
line 1111-->  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,
line 1112-->  Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)
line 1113-->  Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,
line 1114-->  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,
line 1115-->    Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
line 1116-->    Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.
line 1117-->
line 1118-->
line 1119-->                     52
line 1120-->  So am I as the rich whose blessed key,
line 1121-->  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
line 1122-->  The which he will not every hour survey,
line 1123-->  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.  
line 1124-->  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
line 1125-->  Since seldom coming in that long year set,
line 1126-->  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
line 1127-->  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
line 1128-->  So is the time that keeps you as my chest
line 1129-->  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
line 1130-->  To make some special instant special-blest,
line 1131-->  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
line 1132-->    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
line 1133-->    Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.
line 1134-->
line 1135-->
line 1136-->                     53
line 1137-->  What is your substance, whereof are you made,
line 1138-->  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
line 1139-->  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
line 1140-->  And you but one, can every shadow lend:
line 1141-->  Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,
line 1142-->  Is poorly imitated after you,
line 1143-->  On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
line 1144-->  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:  
line 1145-->  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
line 1146-->  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
line 1147-->  The other as your bounty doth appear,
line 1148-->  And you in every blessed shape we know.
line 1149-->    In all external grace you have some part,
line 1150-->    But you like none, none you for constant heart.
line 1151-->
line 1152-->
line 1153-->                     54
line 1154-->  O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,
line 1155-->  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
line 1156-->  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
line 1157-->  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:
line 1158-->  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,
line 1159-->  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
line 1160-->  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
line 1161-->  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
line 1162-->  But for their virtue only is their show,
line 1163-->  They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,
line 1164-->  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,
line 1165-->  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:  
line 1166-->    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
line 1167-->    When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.
line 1168-->
line 1169-->
line 1170-->                     55
line 1171-->  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
line 1172-->  Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
line 1173-->  But you shall shine more bright in these contents
line 1174-->  Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
line 1175-->  When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
line 1176-->  And broils root out the work of masonry,
line 1177-->  Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:
line 1178-->  The living record of your memory.
line 1179-->  'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
line 1180-->  Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,
line 1181-->  Even in the eyes of all posterity
line 1182-->  That wear this world out to the ending doom.
line 1183-->    So till the judgment that your self arise,
line 1184-->    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
line 1185-->
line 1186-->
line 1187-->                     56  
line 1188-->  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
line 1189-->  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
line 1190-->  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
line 1191-->  To-morrow sharpened in his former might.
line 1192-->  So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
line 1193-->  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
line 1194-->  To-morrow see again, and do not kill
line 1195-->  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:
line 1196-->  Let this sad interim like the ocean be
line 1197-->  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,
line 1198-->  Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
line 1199-->  Return of love, more blest may be the view.
line 1200-->    Or call it winter, which being full of care,
line 1201-->    Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
line 1202-->
line 1203-->
line 1204-->                     57
line 1205-->  Being your slave what should I do but tend,
line 1206-->  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
line 1207-->  I have no precious time at all to spend;
line 1208-->  Nor services to do till you require.  
line 1209-->  Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
line 1210-->  Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
line 1211-->  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
line 1212-->  When you have bid your servant once adieu.
line 1213-->  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
line 1214-->  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
line 1215-->  But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
line 1216-->  Save where you are, how happy you make those.
line 1217-->    So true a fool is love, that in your will,
line 1218-->    (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.
line 1219-->
line 1220-->
line 1221-->                     58
line 1222-->  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
line 1223-->  I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
line 1224-->  Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,
line 1225-->  Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.
line 1226-->  O let me suffer (being at your beck)
line 1227-->  Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,
line 1228-->  And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
line 1229-->  Without accusing you of injury.  
line 1230-->  Be where you list, your charter is so strong,
line 1231-->  That you your self may privilage your time
line 1232-->  To what you will, to you it doth belong,
line 1233-->  Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.
line 1234-->    I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
line 1235-->    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
line 1236-->
line 1237-->
line 1238-->                     59
line 1239-->  If there be nothing new, but that which is,
line 1240-->  Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
line 1241-->  Which labouring for invention bear amis
line 1242-->  The second burthen of a former child!
line 1243-->  O that record could with a backward look,
line 1244-->  Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
line 1245-->  Show me your image in some antique book,
line 1246-->  Since mind at first in character was done.
line 1247-->  That I might see what the old world could say,
line 1248-->  To this composed wonder of your frame,
line 1249-->  Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
line 1250-->  Or whether revolution be the same.  
line 1251-->    O sure I am the wits of former days,
line 1252-->    To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
line 1253-->
line 1254-->
line 1255-->                     60
line 1256-->  Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
line 1257-->  So do our minutes hasten to their end,
line 1258-->  Each changing place with that which goes before,
line 1259-->  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
line 1260-->  Nativity once in the main of light,
line 1261-->  Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,
line 1262-->  Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
line 1263-->  And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
line 1264-->  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
line 1265-->  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
line 1266-->  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
line 1267-->  And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
line 1268-->    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
line 1269-->    Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
line 1270-->
line 1271-->
line 1272-->                     61  
line 1273-->  Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
line 1274-->  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
line 1275-->  Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
line 1276-->  While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
line 1277-->  Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
line 1278-->  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
line 1279-->  To find out shames and idle hours in me,
line 1280-->  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
line 1281-->  O no, thy love though much, is not so great,
line 1282-->  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
line 1283-->  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
line 1284-->  To play the watchman ever for thy sake.
line 1285-->    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
line 1286-->    From me far off, with others all too near.
line 1287-->
line 1288-->
line 1289-->                     62
line 1290-->  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
line 1291-->  And all my soul, and all my every part;
line 1292-->  And for this sin there is no remedy,
line 1293-->  It is so grounded inward in my heart.  
line 1294-->  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
line 1295-->  No shape so true, no truth of such account,
line 1296-->  And for my self mine own worth do define,
line 1297-->  As I all other in all worths surmount.
line 1298-->  But when my glass shows me my self indeed
line 1299-->  beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,
line 1300-->  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:
line 1301-->  Self, so self-loving were iniquity.
line 1302-->    'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
line 1303-->    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
line 1304-->
line 1305-->
line 1306-->                     63
line 1307-->  Against my love shall be as I am now
line 1308-->  With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,
line 1309-->  When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
line 1310-->  With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
line 1311-->  Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,
line 1312-->  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
line 1313-->  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
line 1314-->  Stealing away the treasure of his spring:  
line 1315-->  For such a time do I now fortify
line 1316-->  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
line 1317-->  That he shall never cut from memory
line 1318-->  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
line 1319-->    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
line 1320-->    And they shall live, and he in them still green.
line 1321-->
line 1322-->
line 1323-->                     64
line 1324-->  When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
line 1325-->  The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,
line 1326-->  When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,
line 1327-->  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
line 1328-->  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
line 1329-->  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
line 1330-->  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
line 1331-->  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.
line 1332-->  When I have seen such interchange of State,
line 1333-->  Or state it self confounded, to decay,
line 1334-->  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
line 1335-->  That Time will come and take my love away.  
line 1336-->    This thought is as a death which cannot choose
line 1337-->    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
line 1338-->
line 1339-->
line 1340-->                     65
line 1341-->  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
line 1342-->  But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
line 1343-->  How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
line 1344-->  Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
line 1345-->  O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
line 1346-->  Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,
line 1347-->  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
line 1348-->  Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
line 1349-->  O fearful meditation, where alack,
line 1350-->  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
line 1351-->  Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
line 1352-->  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
line 1353-->    O none, unless this miracle have might,
line 1354-->    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
line 1355-->
line 1356-->
line 1357-->                     66  
line 1358-->  Tired with all these for restful death I cry,
line 1359-->  As to behold desert a beggar born,
line 1360-->  And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
line 1361-->  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
line 1362-->  And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
line 1363-->  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
line 1364-->  And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
line 1365-->  And strength by limping sway disabled
line 1366-->  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
line 1367-->  And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
line 1368-->  And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
line 1369-->  And captive good attending captain ill.
line 1370-->    Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
line 1371-->    Save that to die, I leave my love alone.
line 1372-->
line 1373-->
line 1374-->                     67
line 1375-->  Ah wherefore with infection should he live,
line 1376-->  And with his presence grace impiety,
line 1377-->  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
line 1378-->  And lace it self with his society?  
line 1379-->  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
line 1380-->  And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
line 1381-->  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,
line 1382-->  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
line 1383-->  Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
line 1384-->  Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
line 1385-->  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
line 1386-->  And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
line 1387-->    O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,
line 1388-->    In days long since, before these last so bad.
line 1389-->
line 1390-->
line 1391-->                     68
line 1392-->  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
line 1393-->  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
line 1394-->  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
line 1395-->  Or durst inhabit on a living brow:
line 1396-->  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
line 1397-->  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
line 1398-->  To live a second life on second head,
line 1399-->  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:  
line 1400-->  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
line 1401-->  Without all ornament, it self and true,
line 1402-->  Making no summer of another's green,
line 1403-->  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,
line 1404-->    And him as for a map doth Nature store,
line 1405-->    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
line 1406-->
line 1407-->
line 1408-->                     69
line 1409-->  Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,
line 1410-->  Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:
line 1411-->  All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
line 1412-->  Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
line 1413-->  Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
line 1414-->  But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,
line 1415-->  In other accents do this praise confound
line 1416-->  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
line 1417-->  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
line 1418-->  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
line 1419-->  Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
line 1420-->  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:  
line 1421-->    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
line 1422-->    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
line 1423-->
line 1424-->
line 1425-->                     70
line 1426-->  That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
line 1427-->  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair,
line 1428-->  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
line 1429-->  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
line 1430-->  So thou be good, slander doth but approve,
line 1431-->  Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,
line 1432-->  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
line 1433-->  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
line 1434-->  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
line 1435-->  Either not assailed, or victor being charged,
line 1436-->  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
line 1437-->  To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,
line 1438-->    If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,
line 1439-->    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
line 1440-->
line 1441-->
line 1442-->                     71  
line 1443-->  No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
line 1444-->  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
line 1445-->  Give warning to the world that I am fled
line 1446-->  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
line 1447-->  Nay if you read this line, remember not,
line 1448-->  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
line 1449-->  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
line 1450-->  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
line 1451-->  O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
line 1452-->  When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
line 1453-->  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
line 1454-->  But let your love even with my life decay.
line 1455-->    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
line 1456-->    And mock you with me after I am gone.
line 1457-->
line 1458-->
line 1459-->                     72
line 1460-->  O lest the world should task you to recite,
line 1461-->  What merit lived in me that you should love
line 1462-->  After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
line 1463-->  For you in me can nothing worthy prove.  
line 1464-->  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
line 1465-->  To do more for me than mine own desert,
line 1466-->  And hang more praise upon deceased I,
line 1467-->  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
line 1468-->  O lest your true love may seem false in this,
line 1469-->  That you for love speak well of me untrue,
line 1470-->  My name be buried where my body is,
line 1471-->  And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
line 1472-->    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
line 1473-->    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
line 1474-->
line 1475-->
line 1476-->                     73
line 1477-->  That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
line 1478-->  When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
line 1479-->  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
line 1480-->  Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
line 1481-->  In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
line 1482-->  As after sunset fadeth in the west,
line 1483-->  Which by and by black night doth take away,
line 1484-->  Death's second self that seals up all in rest.  
line 1485-->  In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
line 1486-->  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
line 1487-->  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
line 1488-->  Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
line 1489-->    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
line 1490-->    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
line 1491-->
line 1492-->
line 1493-->                     74
line 1494-->  But be contented when that fell arrest,
line 1495-->  Without all bail shall carry me away,
line 1496-->  My life hath in this line some interest,
line 1497-->  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
line 1498-->  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
line 1499-->  The very part was consecrate to thee,
line 1500-->  The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
line 1501-->  My spirit is thine the better part of me,
line 1502-->  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
line 1503-->  The prey of worms, my body being dead,
line 1504-->  The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
line 1505-->  Too base of thee to be remembered,  
line 1506-->    The worth of that, is that which it contains,
line 1507-->    And that is this, and this with thee remains.
line 1508-->
line 1509-->
line 1510-->                     75
line 1511-->  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
line 1512-->  Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
line 1513-->  And for the peace of you I hold such strife
line 1514-->  As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
line 1515-->  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
line 1516-->  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
line 1517-->  Now counting best to be with you alone,
line 1518-->  Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,
line 1519-->  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
line 1520-->  And by and by clean starved for a look,
line 1521-->  Possessing or pursuing no delight
line 1522-->  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
line 1523-->    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
line 1524-->    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
line 1525-->
line 1526-->
line 1527-->                     76  
line 1528-->  Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
line 1529-->  So far from variation or quick change?
line 1530-->  Why with the time do I not glance aside
line 1531-->  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
line 1532-->  Why write I still all one, ever the same,
line 1533-->  And keep invention in a noted weed,
line 1534-->  That every word doth almost tell my name,
line 1535-->  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
line 1536-->  O know sweet love I always write of you,
line 1537-->  And you and love are still my argument:
line 1538-->  So all my best is dressing old words new,
line 1539-->  Spending again what is already spent:
line 1540-->    For as the sun is daily new and old,
line 1541-->    So is my love still telling what is told.
line 1542-->
line 1543-->
line 1544-->                     77
line 1545-->  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
line 1546-->  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,
line 1547-->  These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
line 1548-->  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.  
line 1549-->  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
line 1550-->  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,
line 1551-->  Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,
line 1552-->  Time's thievish progress to eternity.
line 1553-->  Look what thy memory cannot contain,
line 1554-->  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
line 1555-->  Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
line 1556-->  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
line 1557-->    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
line 1558-->    Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.
line 1559-->
line 1560-->
line 1561-->                     78
line 1562-->  So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,
line 1563-->  And found such fair assistance in my verse,
line 1564-->  As every alien pen hath got my use,
line 1565-->  And under thee their poesy disperse.
line 1566-->  Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,
line 1567-->  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
line 1568-->  Have added feathers to the learned's wing,
line 1569-->  And given grace a double majesty.
line 1570-->  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
line 1571-->  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,
line 1572-->  In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
line 1573-->  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
line 1574-->    But thou art all my art, and dost advance
line 1575-->    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.
line 1576-->
line 1577-->
line 1578-->                     79
line 1579-->  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
line 1580-->  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
line 1581-->  But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
line 1582-->  And my sick muse doth give an other place.
line 1583-->  I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
line 1584-->  Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
line 1585-->  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
line 1586-->  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,
line 1587-->  He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
line 1588-->  From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
line 1589-->  And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
line 1590-->  No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.  
line 1591-->    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
line 1592-->    Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.
line 1593-->
line 1594-->
line 1595-->                     80
line 1596-->  O how I faint when I of you do write,
line 1597-->  Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
line 1598-->  And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
line 1599-->  To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
line 1600-->  But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
line 1601-->  The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
line 1602-->  My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
line 1603-->  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
line 1604-->  Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
line 1605-->  Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
line 1606-->  Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,
line 1607-->  He of tall building, and of goodly pride.
line 1608-->    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
line 1609-->    The worst was this, my love was my decay.
line 1610-->
line 1611-->
line 1612-->                     81  
line 1613-->  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
line 1614-->  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,
line 1615-->  From hence your memory death cannot take,
line 1616-->  Although in me each part will be forgotten.
line 1617-->  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
line 1618-->  Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,
line 1619-->  The earth can yield me but a common grave,
line 1620-->  When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,
line 1621-->  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
line 1622-->  Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
line 1623-->  And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
line 1624-->  When all the breathers of this world are dead,
line 1625-->    You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)
line 1626-->    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
line 1627-->
line 1628-->
line 1629-->                     82
line 1630-->  I grant thou wert not married to my muse,
line 1631-->  And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
line 1632-->  The dedicated words which writers use
line 1633-->  Of their fair subject, blessing every book.  
line 1634-->  Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
line 1635-->  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
line 1636-->  And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
line 1637-->  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
line 1638-->  And do so love, yet when they have devised,
line 1639-->  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
line 1640-->  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
line 1641-->  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
line 1642-->    And their gross painting might be better used,
line 1643-->    Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.
line 1644-->
line 1645-->
line 1646-->                     83
line 1647-->  I never saw that you did painting need,
line 1648-->  And therefore to your fair no painting set,
line 1649-->  I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,
line 1650-->  That barren tender of a poet's debt:
line 1651-->  And therefore have I slept in your report,
line 1652-->  That you your self being extant well might show,
line 1653-->  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
line 1654-->  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.  
line 1655-->  This silence for my sin you did impute,
line 1656-->  Which shall be most my glory being dumb,
line 1657-->  For I impair not beauty being mute,
line 1658-->  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
line 1659-->    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,
line 1660-->    Than both your poets can in praise devise.
line 1661-->
line 1662-->
line 1663-->                     84
line 1664-->  Who is it that says most, which can say more,
line 1665-->  Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?
line 1666-->  In whose confine immured is the store,
line 1667-->  Which should example where your equal grew.
line 1668-->  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
line 1669-->  That to his subject lends not some small glory,
line 1670-->  But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
line 1671-->  That you are you, so dignifies his story.
line 1672-->  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
line 1673-->  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
line 1674-->  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
line 1675-->  Making his style admired every where.  
line 1676-->    You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
line 1677-->    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
line 1678-->
line 1679-->
line 1680-->                     85
line 1681-->  My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,
line 1682-->  While comments of your praise richly compiled,
line 1683-->  Reserve their character with golden quill,
line 1684-->  And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
line 1685-->  I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,
line 1686-->  And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
line 1687-->  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
line 1688-->  In polished form of well refined pen.
line 1689-->  Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
line 1690-->  And to the most of praise add something more,
line 1691-->  But that is in my thought, whose love to you
line 1692-->  (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,
line 1693-->    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
line 1694-->    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
line 1695-->
line 1696-->
line 1697-->                     86  
line 1698-->  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
line 1699-->  Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,
line 1700-->  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
line 1701-->  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
line 1702-->  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
line 1703-->  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
line 1704-->  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
line 1705-->  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
line 1706-->  He nor that affable familiar ghost
line 1707-->  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
line 1708-->  As victors of my silence cannot boast,
line 1709-->  I was not sick of any fear from thence.
line 1710-->    But when your countenance filled up his line,
line 1711-->    Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.
line 1712-->
line 1713-->
line 1714-->                     87
line 1715-->  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
line 1716-->  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
line 1717-->  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
line 1718-->  My bonds in thee are all determinate.  
line 1719-->  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
line 1720-->  And for that riches where is my deserving?
line 1721-->  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
line 1722-->  And so my patent back again is swerving.
line 1723-->  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
line 1724-->  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
line 1725-->  So thy great gift upon misprision growing,
line 1726-->  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
line 1727-->    Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,
line 1728-->    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
line 1729-->
line 1730-->
line 1731-->                     88
line 1732-->  When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
line 1733-->  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
line 1734-->  Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,
line 1735-->  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
line 1736-->  With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
line 1737-->  Upon thy part I can set down a story
line 1738-->  Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:
line 1739-->  That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:  
line 1740-->  And I by this will be a gainer too,
line 1741-->  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
line 1742-->  The injuries that to my self I do,
line 1743-->  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
line 1744-->    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
line 1745-->    That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.
line 1746-->
line 1747-->
line 1748-->                     89
line 1749-->  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
line 1750-->  And I will comment upon that offence,
line 1751-->  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:
line 1752-->  Against thy reasons making no defence.
line 1753-->  Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
line 1754-->  To set a form upon desired change,
line 1755-->  As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
line 1756-->  I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
line 1757-->  Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
line 1758-->  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
line 1759-->  Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
line 1760-->  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.  
line 1761-->    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
line 1762-->    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
line 1763-->
line 1764-->
line 1765-->                     90
line 1766-->  Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
line 1767-->  Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
line 1768-->  join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
line 1769-->  And do not drop in for an after-loss:
line 1770-->  Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
line 1771-->  Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,
line 1772-->  Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
line 1773-->  To linger out a purposed overthrow.
line 1774-->  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
line 1775-->  When other petty griefs have done their spite,
line 1776-->  But in the onset come, so shall I taste
line 1777-->  At first the very worst of fortune's might.
line 1778-->    And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
line 1779-->    Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.
line 1780-->
line 1781-->
line 1782-->                     91  
line 1783-->  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
line 1784-->  Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
line 1785-->  Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
line 1786-->  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
line 1787-->  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
line 1788-->  Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,
line 1789-->  But these particulars are not my measure,
line 1790-->  All these I better in one general best.
line 1791-->  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
line 1792-->  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
line 1793-->  Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
line 1794-->  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
line 1795-->    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
line 1796-->    All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
line 1797-->
line 1798-->
line 1799-->                     92
line 1800-->  But do thy worst to steal thy self away,
line 1801-->  For term of life thou art assured mine,
line 1802-->  And life no longer than thy love will stay,
line 1803-->  For it depends upon that love of thine.  
line 1804-->  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
line 1805-->  When in the least of them my life hath end,
line 1806-->  I see, a better state to me belongs
line 1807-->  Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.
line 1808-->  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
line 1809-->  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,
line 1810-->  O what a happy title do I find,
line 1811-->  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
line 1812-->    But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
line 1813-->    Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
line 1814-->
line 1815-->
line 1816-->                     93
line 1817-->  So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
line 1818-->  Like a deceived husband, so love's face,
line 1819-->  May still seem love to me, though altered new:
line 1820-->  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
line 1821-->  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
line 1822-->  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,
line 1823-->  In many's looks, the false heart's history
line 1824-->  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.  
line 1825-->  But heaven in thy creation did decree,
line 1826-->  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
line 1827-->  Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
line 1828-->  Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
line 1829-->    How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
line 1830-->    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
line 1831-->
line 1832-->
line 1833-->                     94
line 1834-->  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
line 1835-->  That do not do the thing, they most do show,
line 1836-->  Who moving others, are themselves as stone,
line 1837-->  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
line 1838-->  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
line 1839-->  And husband nature's riches from expense,
line 1840-->  Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,
line 1841-->  Others, but stewards of their excellence:
line 1842-->  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
line 1843-->  Though to it self, it only live and die,
line 1844-->  But if that flower with base infection meet,
line 1845-->  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:  
line 1846-->    For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
line 1847-->    Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
line 1848-->
line 1849-->
line 1850-->                     95
line 1851-->  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
line 1852-->  Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,
line 1853-->  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
line 1854-->  O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
line 1855-->  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
line 1856-->  (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
line 1857-->  Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,
line 1858-->  Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
line 1859-->  O what a mansion have those vices got,
line 1860-->  Which for their habitation chose out thee,
line 1861-->  Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
line 1862-->  And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
line 1863-->    Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,
line 1864-->    The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
line 1865-->
line 1866-->
line 1867-->                     96  
line 1868-->  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
line 1869-->  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
line 1870-->  Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
line 1871-->  Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:
line 1872-->  As on the finger of a throned queen,
line 1873-->  The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
line 1874-->  So are those errors that in thee are seen,
line 1875-->  To truths translated, and for true things deemed.
line 1876-->  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
line 1877-->  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
line 1878-->  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
line 1879-->  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
line 1880-->    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
line 1881-->    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
line 1882-->
line 1883-->
line 1884-->                     97
line 1885-->  How like a winter hath my absence been
line 1886-->  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
line 1887-->  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
line 1888-->  What old December's bareness everywhere!  
line 1889-->  And yet this time removed was summer's time,
line 1890-->  The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
line 1891-->  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
line 1892-->  Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:
line 1893-->  Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
line 1894-->  But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,
line 1895-->  For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
line 1896-->  And thou away, the very birds are mute.
line 1897-->    Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
line 1898-->    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
line 1899-->
line 1900-->
line 1901-->                     98
line 1902-->  From you have I been absent in the spring,
line 1903-->  When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)
line 1904-->  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:
line 1905-->  That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
line 1906-->  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
line 1907-->  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
line 1908-->  Could make me any summer's story tell:
line 1909-->  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:  
line 1910-->  Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
line 1911-->  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,
line 1912-->  They were but sweet, but figures of delight:
line 1913-->  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
line 1914-->    Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,
line 1915-->    As with your shadow I with these did play.
line 1916-->
line 1917-->
line 1918-->                     99
line 1919-->  The forward violet thus did I chide,
line 1920-->  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
line 1921-->  If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
line 1922-->  Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,
line 1923-->  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
line 1924-->  The lily I condemned for thy hand,
line 1925-->  And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,
line 1926-->  The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
line 1927-->  One blushing shame, another white despair:
line 1928-->  A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
line 1929-->  And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
line 1930-->  But for his theft in pride of all his growth  
line 1931-->  A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
line 1932-->    More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
line 1933-->    But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.
line 1934-->
line 1935-->
line 1936-->                     100
line 1937-->  Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
line 1938-->  To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
line 1939-->  Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
line 1940-->  Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
line 1941-->  Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
line 1942-->  In gentle numbers time so idly spent,
line 1943-->  Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,
line 1944-->  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
line 1945-->  Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
line 1946-->  If time have any wrinkle graven there,
line 1947-->  If any, be a satire to decay,
line 1948-->  And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
line 1949-->    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
line 1950-->    So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.
line 1951-->
line 1952-->  
line 1953-->                     101
line 1954-->  O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
line 1955-->  For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
line 1956-->  Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
line 1957-->  So dost thou too, and therein dignified:
line 1958-->  Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
line 1959-->  'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
line 1960-->  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:
line 1961-->  But best is best, if never intermixed'?
line 1962-->  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
line 1963-->  Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,
line 1964-->  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
line 1965-->  And to be praised of ages yet to be.
line 1966-->    Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,
line 1967-->    To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.
line 1968-->
line 1969-->
line 1970-->                     102
line 1971-->  My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
line 1972-->  I love not less, though less the show appear,
line 1973-->  That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,  
line 1974-->  The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
line 1975-->  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
line 1976-->  When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
line 1977-->  As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
line 1978-->  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
line 1979-->  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
line 1980-->  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
line 1981-->  But that wild music burthens every bough,
line 1982-->  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
line 1983-->    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
line 1984-->    Because I would not dull you with my song.
line 1985-->
line 1986-->
line 1987-->                     103
line 1988-->  Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
line 1989-->  That having such a scope to show her pride,
line 1990-->  The argument all bare is of more worth
line 1991-->  Than when it hath my added praise beside.
line 1992-->  O blame me not if I no more can write!
line 1993-->  Look in your glass and there appears a face,
line 1994-->  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,  
line 1995-->  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
line 1996-->  Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
line 1997-->  To mar the subject that before was well?
line 1998-->  For to no other pass my verses tend,
line 1999-->  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
line 2000-->    And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
line 2001-->    Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.
line 2002-->
line 2003-->
line 2004-->                     104
line 2005-->  To me fair friend you never can be old,
line 2006-->  For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
line 2007-->  Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,
line 2008-->  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
line 2009-->  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
line 2010-->  In process of the seasons have I seen,
line 2011-->  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
line 2012-->  Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.
line 2013-->  Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,
line 2014-->  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,
line 2015-->  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand  
line 2016-->  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.
line 2017-->    For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,
line 2018-->    Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
line 2019-->
line 2020-->
line 2021-->                     105
line 2022-->  Let not my love be called idolatry,
line 2023-->  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
line 2024-->  Since all alike my songs and praises be
line 2025-->  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
line 2026-->  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
line 2027-->  Still constant in a wondrous excellence,
line 2028-->  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
line 2029-->  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
line 2030-->  Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,
line 2031-->  Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,
line 2032-->  And in this change is my invention spent,
line 2033-->  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
line 2034-->    Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.
line 2035-->    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
line 2036-->
line 2037-->  
line 2038-->                     106
line 2039-->  When in the chronicle of wasted time,
line 2040-->  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
line 2041-->  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
line 2042-->  In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
line 2043-->  Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
line 2044-->  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
line 2045-->  I see their antique pen would have expressed,
line 2046-->  Even such a beauty as you master now.
line 2047-->  So all their praises are but prophecies
line 2048-->  Of this our time, all you prefiguring,
line 2049-->  And for they looked but with divining eyes,
line 2050-->  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
line 2051-->    For we which now behold these present days,
line 2052-->    Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
line 2053-->
line 2054-->
line 2055-->                     107
line 2056-->  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,
line 2057-->  Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,
line 2058-->  Can yet the lease of my true love control,  
line 2059-->  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
line 2060-->  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
line 2061-->  And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
line 2062-->  Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
line 2063-->  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
line 2064-->  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
line 2065-->  My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
line 2066-->  Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,
line 2067-->  While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.
line 2068-->    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
line 2069-->    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
line 2070-->
line 2071-->
line 2072-->                     108
line 2073-->  What's in the brain that ink may character,
line 2074-->  Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,
line 2075-->  What's new to speak, what now to register,
line 2076-->  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
line 2077-->  Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,
line 2078-->  I must each day say o'er the very same,
line 2079-->  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,  
line 2080-->  Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.
line 2081-->  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
line 2082-->  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
line 2083-->  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
line 2084-->  But makes antiquity for aye his page,
line 2085-->    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
line 2086-->    Where time and outward form would show it dead.
line 2087-->
line 2088-->
line 2089-->                     109
line 2090-->  O never say that I was false of heart,
line 2091-->  Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,
line 2092-->  As easy might I from my self depart,
line 2093-->  As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
line 2094-->  That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
line 2095-->  Like him that travels I return again,
line 2096-->  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
line 2097-->  So that my self bring water for my stain,
line 2098-->  Never believe though in my nature reigned,
line 2099-->  All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
line 2100-->  That it could so preposterously be stained,  
line 2101-->  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:
line 2102-->    For nothing this wide universe I call,
line 2103-->    Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.
line 2104-->
line 2105-->
line 2106-->                     110
line 2107-->  Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
line 2108-->  And made my self a motley to the view,
line 2109-->  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
line 2110-->  Made old offences of affections new.
line 2111-->  Most true it is, that I have looked on truth
line 2112-->  Askance and strangely: but by all above,
line 2113-->  These blenches gave my heart another youth,
line 2114-->  And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
line 2115-->  Now all is done, have what shall have no end,
line 2116-->  Mine appetite I never more will grind
line 2117-->  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
line 2118-->  A god in love, to whom I am confined.
line 2119-->    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
line 2120-->    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
line 2121-->
line 2122-->  
line 2123-->                     111
line 2124-->  O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
line 2125-->  The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
line 2126-->  That did not better for my life provide,
line 2127-->  Than public means which public manners breeds.
line 2128-->  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
line 2129-->  And almost thence my nature is subdued
line 2130-->  To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
line 2131-->  Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,
line 2132-->  Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,
line 2133-->  Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection,
line 2134-->  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
line 2135-->  Nor double penance to correct correction.
line 2136-->    Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,
line 2137-->    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
line 2138-->
line 2139-->
line 2140-->                     112
line 2141-->  Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
line 2142-->  Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
line 2143-->  For what care I who calls me well or ill,  
line 2144-->  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
line 2145-->  You are my all the world, and I must strive,
line 2146-->  To know my shames and praises from your tongue,
line 2147-->  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
line 2148-->  That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
line 2149-->  In so profound abysm I throw all care
line 2150-->  Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,
line 2151-->  To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
line 2152-->  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.
line 2153-->    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
line 2154-->    That all the world besides methinks are dead.
line 2155-->
line 2156-->
line 2157-->                     113
line 2158-->  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
line 2159-->  And that which governs me to go about,
line 2160-->  Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
line 2161-->  Seems seeing, but effectually is out:
line 2162-->  For it no form delivers to the heart
line 2163-->  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,
line 2164-->  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,  
line 2165-->  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
line 2166-->  For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
line 2167-->  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
line 2168-->  The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:
line 2169-->  The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
line 2170-->    Incapable of more, replete with you,
line 2171-->    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
line 2172-->
line 2173-->
line 2174-->                     114
line 2175-->  Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
line 2176-->  Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?
line 2177-->  Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
line 2178-->  And that your love taught it this alchemy?
line 2179-->  To make of monsters, and things indigest,
line 2180-->  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
line 2181-->  Creating every bad a perfect best
line 2182-->  As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
line 2183-->  O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
line 2184-->  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
line 2185-->  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,  
line 2186-->  And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
line 2187-->    If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,
line 2188-->    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
line 2189-->
line 2190-->
line 2191-->                     115
line 2192-->  Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
line 2193-->  Even those that said I could not love you dearer,
line 2194-->  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,
line 2195-->  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,
line 2196-->  But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
line 2197-->  Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
line 2198-->  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
line 2199-->  Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:
line 2200-->  Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
line 2201-->  Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
line 2202-->  When I was certain o'er incertainty,
line 2203-->  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
line 2204-->    Love is a babe, then might I not say so
line 2205-->    To give full growth to that which still doth grow.
line 2206-->
line 2207-->  
line 2208-->                     116
line 2209-->  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
line 2210-->  Admit impediments, love is not love
line 2211-->  Which alters when it alteration finds,
line 2212-->  Or bends with the remover to remove.
line 2213-->  O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
line 2214-->  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
line 2215-->  It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
line 2216-->  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
line 2217-->  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
line 2218-->  Within his bending sickle's compass come,
line 2219-->  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
line 2220-->  But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
line 2221-->    If this be error and upon me proved,
line 2222-->    I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
line 2223-->
line 2224-->
line 2225-->                     117
line 2226-->  Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
line 2227-->  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
line 2228-->  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,  
line 2229-->  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
line 2230-->  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
line 2231-->  And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
line 2232-->  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
line 2233-->  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
line 2234-->  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
line 2235-->  And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
line 2236-->  Bring me within the level of your frown,
line 2237-->  But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
line 2238-->    Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
line 2239-->    The constancy and virtue of your love.
line 2240-->
line 2241-->
line 2242-->                     118
line 2243-->  Like as to make our appetite more keen
line 2244-->  With eager compounds we our palate urge,
line 2245-->  As to prevent our maladies unseen,
line 2246-->  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.
line 2247-->  Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
line 2248-->  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
line 2249-->  And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,  
line 2250-->  To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
line 2251-->  Thus policy in love t' anticipate
line 2252-->  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,
line 2253-->  And brought to medicine a healthful state
line 2254-->  Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.
line 2255-->    But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
line 2256-->    Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.
line 2257-->
line 2258-->
line 2259-->                     119
line 2260-->  What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
line 2261-->  Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
line 2262-->  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
line 2263-->  Still losing when I saw my self to win!
line 2264-->  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
line 2265-->  Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
line 2266-->  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
line 2267-->  In the distraction of this madding fever!
line 2268-->  O benefit of ill, now I find true
line 2269-->  That better is, by evil still made better.
line 2270-->  And ruined love when it is built anew  
line 2271-->  Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
line 2272-->    So I return rebuked to my content,
line 2273-->    And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
line 2274-->
line 2275-->
line 2276-->                     120
line 2277-->  That you were once unkind befriends me now,
line 2278-->  And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
line 2279-->  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
line 2280-->  Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
line 2281-->  For if you were by my unkindness shaken
line 2282-->  As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,
line 2283-->  And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
line 2284-->  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
line 2285-->  O that our night of woe might have remembered
line 2286-->  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
line 2287-->  And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
line 2288-->  The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
line 2289-->    But that your trespass now becomes a fee,
line 2290-->    Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
line 2291-->
line 2292-->  
line 2293-->                     121
line 2294-->  'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
line 2295-->  When not to be, receives reproach of being,
line 2296-->  And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
line 2297-->  Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.
line 2298-->  For why should others' false adulterate eyes
line 2299-->  Give salutation to my sportive blood?
line 2300-->  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
line 2301-->  Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
line 2302-->  No, I am that I am, and they that level
line 2303-->  At my abuses, reckon up their own,
line 2304-->  I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
line 2305-->  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown
line 2306-->    Unless this general evil they maintain,
line 2307-->    All men are bad and in their badness reign.
line 2308-->
line 2309-->
line 2310-->                     122
line 2311-->  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
line 2312-->  Full charactered with lasting memory,
line 2313-->  Which shall above that idle rank remain  
line 2314-->  Beyond all date even to eternity.
line 2315-->  Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
line 2316-->  Have faculty by nature to subsist,
line 2317-->  Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
line 2318-->  Of thee, thy record never can be missed:
line 2319-->  That poor retention could not so much hold,
line 2320-->  Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,
line 2321-->  Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
line 2322-->  To trust those tables that receive thee more:
line 2323-->    To keep an adjunct to remember thee
line 2324-->    Were to import forgetfulness in me.
line 2325-->
line 2326-->
line 2327-->                     123
line 2328-->  No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,
line 2329-->  Thy pyramids built up with newer might
line 2330-->  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,
line 2331-->  They are but dressings Of a former sight:
line 2332-->  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,
line 2333-->  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
line 2334-->  And rather make them born to our desire,  
line 2335-->  Than think that we before have heard them told:
line 2336-->  Thy registers and thee I both defy,
line 2337-->  Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,
line 2338-->  For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
line 2339-->  Made more or less by thy continual haste:
line 2340-->    This I do vow and this shall ever be,
line 2341-->    I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
line 2342-->
line 2343-->
line 2344-->                     124
line 2345-->  If my dear love were but the child of state,
line 2346-->  It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,
line 2347-->  As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
line 2348-->  Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
line 2349-->  No it was builded far from accident,
line 2350-->  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
line 2351-->  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
line 2352-->  Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
line 2353-->  It fears not policy that heretic,
line 2354-->  Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,
line 2355-->  But all alone stands hugely politic,  
line 2356-->  That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
line 2357-->    To this I witness call the fools of time,
line 2358-->    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
line 2359-->
line 2360-->
line 2361-->                     125
line 2362-->  Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
line 2363-->  With my extern the outward honouring,
line 2364-->  Or laid great bases for eternity,
line 2365-->  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
line 2366-->  Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
line 2367-->  Lose all, and more by paying too much rent
line 2368-->  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
line 2369-->  Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?
line 2370-->  No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
line 2371-->  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
line 2372-->  Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,
line 2373-->  But mutual render, only me for thee.
line 2374-->    Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul
line 2375-->    When most impeached, stands least in thy control.
line 2376-->
line 2377-->  
line 2378-->                     126
line 2379-->  O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
line 2380-->  Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:
line 2381-->  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,
line 2382-->  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
line 2383-->  If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
line 2384-->  As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
line 2385-->  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
line 2386-->  May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
line 2387-->  Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
line 2388-->  She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
line 2389-->    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
line 2390-->    And her quietus is to render thee.
line 2391-->
line 2392-->
line 2393-->                     127
line 2394-->  In the old age black was not counted fair,
line 2395-->  Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:
line 2396-->  But now is black beauty's successive heir,
line 2397-->  And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,
line 2398-->  For since each hand hath put on nature's power,  
line 2399-->  Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,
line 2400-->  Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
line 2401-->  But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
line 2402-->  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
line 2403-->  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
line 2404-->  At such who not born fair no beauty lack,
line 2405-->  Slandering creation with a false esteem,
line 2406-->    Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
line 2407-->    That every tongue says beauty should look so.
line 2408-->
line 2409-->
line 2410-->                     128
line 2411-->  How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
line 2412-->  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
line 2413-->  With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
line 2414-->  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
line 2415-->  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
line 2416-->  To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
line 2417-->  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
line 2418-->  At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
line 2419-->  To be so tickled they would change their state  
line 2420-->  And situation with those dancing chips,
line 2421-->  O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
line 2422-->  Making dead wood more blest than living lips,
line 2423-->    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
line 2424-->    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
line 2425-->
line 2426-->
line 2427-->                     129
line 2428-->  Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
line 2429-->  Is lust in action, and till action, lust
line 2430-->  Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,
line 2431-->  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
line 2432-->  Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
line 2433-->  Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
line 2434-->  Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,
line 2435-->  On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
line 2436-->  Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
line 2437-->  Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,
line 2438-->  A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
line 2439-->  Before a joy proposed behind a dream.
line 2440-->    All this the world well knows yet none knows well,  
line 2441-->    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
line 2442-->
line 2443-->
line 2444-->                     130
line 2445-->  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
line 2446-->  Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
line 2447-->  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
line 2448-->  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:
line 2449-->  I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
line 2450-->  But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
line 2451-->  And in some perfumes is there more delight,
line 2452-->  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
line 2453-->  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
line 2454-->  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
line 2455-->  I grant I never saw a goddess go,
line 2456-->  My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
line 2457-->    And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
line 2458-->    As any she belied with false compare.
line 2459-->
line 2460-->
line 2461-->                     131
line 2462-->  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,  
line 2463-->  As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
line 2464-->  For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
line 2465-->  Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
line 2466-->  Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
line 2467-->  Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
line 2468-->  To say they err, I dare not be so bold,
line 2469-->  Although I swear it to my self alone.
line 2470-->  And to be sure that is not false I swear,
line 2471-->  A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
line 2472-->  One on another's neck do witness bear
line 2473-->  Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
line 2474-->    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
line 2475-->    And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
line 2476-->
line 2477-->
line 2478-->                     132
line 2479-->  Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
line 2480-->  Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
line 2481-->  Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
line 2482-->  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
line 2483-->  And truly not the morning sun of heaven  
line 2484-->  Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
line 2485-->  Nor that full star that ushers in the even
line 2486-->  Doth half that glory to the sober west
line 2487-->  As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
line 2488-->  O let it then as well beseem thy heart
line 2489-->  To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
line 2490-->  And suit thy pity like in every part.
line 2491-->    Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
line 2492-->    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
line 2493-->
line 2494-->
line 2495-->                     133
line 2496-->  Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
line 2497-->  For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
line 2498-->  Is't not enough to torture me alone,
line 2499-->  But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
line 2500-->  Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,
line 2501-->  And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,
line 2502-->  Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,
line 2503-->  A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
line 2504-->  Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,  
line 2505-->  But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,
line 2506-->  Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,
line 2507-->  Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
line 2508-->    And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,
line 2509-->    Perforce am thine and all that is in me.
line 2510-->
line 2511-->
line 2512-->                     134
line 2513-->  So now I have confessed that he is thine,
line 2514-->  And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
line 2515-->  My self I'll forfeit, so that other mine,
line 2516-->  Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
line 2517-->  But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
line 2518-->  For thou art covetous, and he is kind,
line 2519-->  He learned but surety-like to write for me,
line 2520-->  Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
line 2521-->  The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
line 2522-->  Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,
line 2523-->  And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
line 2524-->  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
line 2525-->    Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,  
line 2526-->    He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.
line 2527-->
line 2528-->
line 2529-->                     135
line 2530-->  Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
line 2531-->  And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,
line 2532-->  More than enough am I that vex thee still,
line 2533-->  To thy sweet will making addition thus.
line 2534-->  Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,
line 2535-->  Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
line 2536-->  Shall will in others seem right gracious,
line 2537-->  And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
line 2538-->  The sea all water, yet receives rain still,
line 2539-->  And in abundance addeth to his store,
line 2540-->  So thou being rich in will add to thy will
line 2541-->  One will of mine to make thy large will more.
line 2542-->    Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,
line 2543-->    Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'
line 2544-->
line 2545-->
line 2546-->                     136
line 2547-->  If thy soul check thee that I come so near,  
line 2548-->  Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
line 2549-->  And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
line 2550-->  Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.
line 2551-->  'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
line 2552-->  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,
line 2553-->  In things of great receipt with case we prove,
line 2554-->  Among a number one is reckoned none.
line 2555-->  Then in the number let me pass untold,
line 2556-->  Though in thy store's account I one must be,
line 2557-->  For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,
line 2558-->  That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.
line 2559-->    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
line 2560-->    And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.
line 2561-->
line 2562-->
line 2563-->                     137
line 2564-->  Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
line 2565-->  That they behold and see not what they see?
line 2566-->  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
line 2567-->  Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.
line 2568-->  If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,  
line 2569-->  Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,
line 2570-->  Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
line 2571-->  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
line 2572-->  Why should my heart think that a several plot,
line 2573-->  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
line 2574-->  Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not
line 2575-->  To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
line 2576-->    In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
line 2577-->    And to this false plague are they now transferred.
line 2578-->
line 2579-->
line 2580-->                     138
line 2581-->  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
line 2582-->  I do believe her though I know she lies,
line 2583-->  That she might think me some untutored youth,
line 2584-->  Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
line 2585-->  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
line 2586-->  Although she knows my days are past the best,
line 2587-->  Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,
line 2588-->  On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
line 2589-->  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?  
line 2590-->  And wherefore say not I that I am old?
line 2591-->  O love's best habit is in seeming trust,
line 2592-->  And age in love, loves not to have years told.
line 2593-->    Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
line 2594-->    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.
line 2595-->
line 2596-->
line 2597-->                     139
line 2598-->  O call not me to justify the wrong,
line 2599-->  That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,
line 2600-->  Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,
line 2601-->  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
line 2602-->  Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
line 2603-->  Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,
line 2604-->  What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
line 2605-->  Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?
line 2606-->  Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
line 2607-->  Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
line 2608-->  And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
line 2609-->  That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
line 2610-->    Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,  
line 2611-->    Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.
line 2612-->
line 2613-->
line 2614-->                     140
line 2615-->  Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
line 2616-->  My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:
line 2617-->  Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,
line 2618-->  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
line 2619-->  If I might teach thee wit better it were,
line 2620-->  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
line 2621-->  As testy sick men when their deaths be near,
line 2622-->  No news but health from their physicians know.
line 2623-->  For if I should despair I should grow mad,
line 2624-->  And in my madness might speak ill of thee,
line 2625-->  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
line 2626-->  Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
line 2627-->    That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
line 2628-->    Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
line 2629-->
line 2630-->
line 2631-->                     141
line 2632-->  In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,  
line 2633-->  For they in thee a thousand errors note,
line 2634-->  But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
line 2635-->  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
line 2636-->  Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,
line 2637-->  Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
line 2638-->  Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
line 2639-->  To any sensual feast with thee alone:
line 2640-->  But my five wits, nor my five senses can
line 2641-->  Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
line 2642-->  Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
line 2643-->  Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
line 2644-->    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
line 2645-->    That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.
line 2646-->
line 2647-->
line 2648-->                     142
line 2649-->  Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
line 2650-->  Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
line 2651-->  O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
line 2652-->  And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
line 2653-->  Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,  
line 2654-->  That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,
line 2655-->  And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
line 2656-->  Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
line 2657-->  Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,
line 2658-->  Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,
line 2659-->  Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,
line 2660-->  Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
line 2661-->    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
line 2662-->    By self-example mayst thou be denied.
line 2663-->
line 2664-->
line 2665-->                     143
line 2666-->  Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,
line 2667-->  One of her feathered creatures broke away,
line 2668-->  Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
line 2669-->  In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
line 2670-->  Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
line 2671-->  Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,
line 2672-->  To follow that which flies before her face:
line 2673-->  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
line 2674-->  So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,  
line 2675-->  Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,
line 2676-->  But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
line 2677-->  And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.
line 2678-->    So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,
line 2679-->    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.
line 2680-->
line 2681-->
line 2682-->                     144
line 2683-->  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
line 2684-->  Which like two spirits do suggest me still,
line 2685-->  The better angel is a man right fair:
line 2686-->  The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
line 2687-->  To win me soon to hell my female evil,
line 2688-->  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
line 2689-->  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
line 2690-->  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
line 2691-->  And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
line 2692-->  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
line 2693-->  But being both from me both to each friend,
line 2694-->  I guess one angel in another's hell.
line 2695-->    Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,  
line 2696-->    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
line 2697-->
line 2698-->
line 2699-->                     145
line 2700-->  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
line 2701-->  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
line 2702-->  To me that languished for her sake:
line 2703-->  But when she saw my woeful state,
line 2704-->  Straight in her heart did mercy come,
line 2705-->  Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
line 2706-->  Was used in giving gentle doom:
line 2707-->  And taught it thus anew to greet:
line 2708-->  'I hate' she altered with an end,
line 2709-->  That followed it as gentle day,
line 2710-->  Doth follow night who like a fiend
line 2711-->  From heaven to hell is flown away.
line 2712-->    'I hate', from hate away she threw,
line 2713-->    And saved my life saying 'not you'.
line 2714-->
line 2715-->
line 2716-->                     146
line 2717-->  Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,  
line 2718-->  My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
line 2719-->  Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
line 2720-->  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
line 2721-->  Why so large cost having so short a lease,
line 2722-->  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
line 2723-->  Shall worms inheritors of this excess
line 2724-->  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
line 2725-->  Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,
line 2726-->  And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
line 2727-->  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
line 2728-->  Within be fed, without be rich no more,
line 2729-->    So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,
line 2730-->    And death once dead, there's no more dying then.
line 2731-->
line 2732-->
line 2733-->                     147
line 2734-->  My love is as a fever longing still,
line 2735-->  For that which longer nurseth the disease,
line 2736-->  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
line 2737-->  Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:
line 2738-->  My reason the physician to my love,  
line 2739-->  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
line 2740-->  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,
line 2741-->  Desire is death, which physic did except.
line 2742-->  Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
line 2743-->  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
line 2744-->  My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,
line 2745-->  At random from the truth vainly expressed.
line 2746-->    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
line 2747-->    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
line 2748-->
line 2749-->
line 2750-->                     148
line 2751-->  O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
line 2752-->  Which have no correspondence with true sight,
line 2753-->  Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
line 2754-->  That censures falsely what they see aright?
line 2755-->  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
line 2756-->  What means the world to say it is not so?
line 2757-->  If it be not, then love doth well denote,
line 2758-->  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
line 2759-->  How can it? O how can love's eye be true,  
line 2760-->  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
line 2761-->  No marvel then though I mistake my view,
line 2762-->  The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.
line 2763-->    O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,
line 2764-->    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
line 2765-->
line 2766-->
line 2767-->                     149
line 2768-->  Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,
line 2769-->  When I against my self with thee partake?
line 2770-->  Do I not think on thee when I forgot
line 2771-->  Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
line 2772-->  Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
line 2773-->  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
line 2774-->  Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
line 2775-->  Revenge upon my self with present moan?
line 2776-->  What merit do I in my self respect,
line 2777-->  That is so proud thy service to despise,
line 2778-->  When all my best doth worship thy defect,
line 2779-->  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
line 2780-->    But love hate on for now I know thy mind,  
line 2781-->    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.
line 2782-->
line 2783-->
line 2784-->                     150
line 2785-->  O from what power hast thou this powerful might,
line 2786-->  With insufficiency my heart to sway,
line 2787-->  To make me give the lie to my true sight,
line 2788-->  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
line 2789-->  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
line 2790-->  That in the very refuse of thy deeds,
line 2791-->  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
line 2792-->  That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
line 2793-->  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
line 2794-->  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
line 2795-->  O though I love what others do abhor,
line 2796-->  With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
line 2797-->    If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
line 2798-->    More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
line 2799-->
line 2800-->
line 2801-->                     151
line 2802-->  Love is too young to know what conscience is,  
line 2803-->  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
line 2804-->  Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
line 2805-->  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
line 2806-->  For thou betraying me, I do betray
line 2807-->  My nobler part to my gross body's treason,
line 2808-->  My soul doth tell my body that he may,
line 2809-->  Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
line 2810-->  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
line 2811-->  As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,
line 2812-->  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
line 2813-->  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
line 2814-->    No want of conscience hold it that I call,
line 2815-->    Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.
line 2816-->
line 2817-->
line 2818-->                     152
line 2819-->  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
line 2820-->  But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
line 2821-->  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
line 2822-->  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
line 2823-->  But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,  
line 2824-->  When I break twenty? I am perjured most,
line 2825-->  For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
line 2826-->  And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
line 2827-->  For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
line 2828-->  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
line 2829-->  And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
line 2830-->  Or made them swear against the thing they see.
line 2831-->    For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,
line 2832-->    To swear against the truth so foul a be.
line 2833-->
line 2834-->
line 2835-->                     153
line 2836-->  Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,
line 2837-->  A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
line 2838-->  And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
line 2839-->  In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:
line 2840-->  Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
line 2841-->  A dateless lively heat still to endure,
line 2842-->  And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
line 2843-->  Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:
line 2844-->  But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,  
line 2845-->  The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,
line 2846-->  I sick withal the help of bath desired,
line 2847-->  And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
line 2848-->    But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,
line 2849-->    Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.
line 2850-->
line 2851-->
line 2852-->                     154
line 2853-->  The little Love-god lying once asleep,
line 2854-->  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
line 2855-->  Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
line 2856-->  Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,
line 2857-->  The fairest votary took up that fire,
line 2858-->  Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,
line 2859-->  And so the general of hot desire,
line 2860-->  Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.
line 2861-->  This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
line 2862-->  Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
line 2863-->  Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
line 2864-->  For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,
line 2865-->    Came there for cure and this by that I prove,  
line 2866-->    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

line 2931-->SCENE:
line 2932-->Rousillon; Paris; Florence; Marseilles
line 2933-->
line 2934-->
line 2935-->ACT I. SCENE 1.
line 2936-->Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
line 2937-->
line 2938-->Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black
line 2939-->
line 2940-->  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
line 2941-->  BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew;
line 2942-->    but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in
line 2943-->    ward, evermore in subjection.
line 2944-->  LAFEU. You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a
line 2945-->    father. He that so generally is at all times good must of
line 2946-->    necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it
line 2947-->    up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such
line 2948-->    abundance.
line 2949-->  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?
line 2950-->  LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose
line 2951-->    practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other
line 2952-->    advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
line 2953-->  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how
line 2954-->    sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his
line 2955-->    honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature  
line 2956-->    immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for
line 2957-->    the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of
line 2958-->    the King's disease.
line 2959-->  LAFEU. How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?
line 2960-->  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his
line 2961-->    great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.
line 2962-->  LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
line 2963-->    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
line 2964-->    liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
line 2965-->  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
line 2966-->  LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.
line 2967-->  BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.
line 2968-->  LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the
line 2969-->    daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
line 2970-->  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
line 2971-->    overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education
line 2972-->    promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
line 2973-->    fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
line 2974-->    there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors
line 2975-->    too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives  
line 2976-->    her honesty, and achieves her goodness.
line 2977-->  LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
line 2978-->  COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.
line 2979-->    The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
line 2980-->    tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No
line 2981-->    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought
line 2982-->    you affect a sorrow than to have-
line 2983-->  HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
line 2984-->  LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive
line 2985-->    grief the enemy to the living.
line 2986-->  COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
line 2987-->    soon mortal.
line 2988-->  BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
line 2989-->  LAFEU. How understand we that?
line 2990-->  COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
line 2991-->    In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue
line 2992-->    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
line 2993-->    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
line 2994-->    Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy
line 2995-->    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend  
line 2996-->    Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,
line 2997-->    But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
line 2998-->    That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
line 2999-->    Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,
line 3000-->    'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
line 3001-->    Advise him.
line 3002-->  LAFEU. He cannot want the best
line 3003-->    That shall attend his love.
line 3004-->  COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit
line 3005-->  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be
line 3006-->    servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother, your
line 3007-->    mistress, and make much of her.
line 3008-->  LAFEU. Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your
line 3009-->    father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
line 3010-->  HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;
line 3011-->    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
line 3012-->    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
line 3013-->    I have forgot him; my imagination
line 3014-->    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
line 3015-->    I am undone; there is no living, none,  
line 3016-->    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
line 3017-->    That I should love a bright particular star
line 3018-->    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
line 3019-->    In his bright radiance and collateral light
line 3020-->    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
line 3021-->    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
line 3022-->    The hind that would be mated by the lion
line 3023-->    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
line 3024-->    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
line 3025-->    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
line 3026-->    In our heart's table-heart too capable
line 3027-->    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
line 3028-->    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
line 3029-->    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?
line 3030-->
line 3031-->                       Enter PAROLLES
line 3032-->
line 3033-->    [Aside]  One that goes with him. I love him for his sake;
line 3034-->    And yet I know him a notorious liar,
line 3035-->    Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;  
line 3036-->    Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
line 3037-->    That they take place when virtue's steely bones
line 3038-->    Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see
line 3039-->    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
line 3040-->  PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!
line 3041-->  HELENA. And you, monarch!
line 3042-->  PAROLLES. No.
line 3043-->  HELENA. And no.
line 3044-->  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?
line 3045-->  HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a
line 3046-->    question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it
line 3047-->    against him?
line 3048-->  PAROLLES. Keep him out.
line 3049-->  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the
line 3050-->    defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
line 3051-->  PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will
line 3052-->    undermine you and blow you up.
line 3053-->  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!
line 3054-->    Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?
line 3055-->  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown  
line 3056-->    up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves
line 3057-->     made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth
line 3058-->    of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
line 3059-->    increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
line 3060-->    lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity
line 3061-->    by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it
line 3062-->    is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.
line 3063-->  HELENA. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a
line 3064-->    virgin.
line 3065-->  PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule
line 3066-->    of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
line 3067-->    mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs
line 3068-->    himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be
line 3069-->    buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
line 3070-->    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a
line 3071-->    cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with
line 3072-->    feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud,
line 3073-->    idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
line 3074-->    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't.
line 3075-->    Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly  
line 3076-->    increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away
line 3077-->    with't.
line 3078-->  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
line 3079-->  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes.
line 3080-->    'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
line 3081-->    the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time
line 3082-->    of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of
line 3083-->    fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and
line 3084-->    the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your
line 3085-->    pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,
line 3086-->    your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it
line 3087-->    looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was
line 3088-->    formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you
line 3089-->    anything with it?
line 3090-->  HELENA. Not my virginity yet.
line 3091-->    There shall your master have a thousand loves,
line 3092-->    A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
line 3093-->    A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
line 3094-->    A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
line 3095-->    A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
line 3096-->    His humble ambition, proud humility,
line 3097-->    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
line 3098-->    His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
line 3099-->    Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms
line 3100-->    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-
line 3101-->    I know not what he shall. God send him well!
line 3102-->    The court's a learning-place, and he is one-
line 3103-->  PAROLLES. What one, i' faith?
line 3104-->  HELENA. That I wish well. 'Tis pity-
line 3105-->  PAROLLES. What's pity?
line 3106-->  HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in't
line 3107-->    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
line 3108-->    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
line 3109-->    Might with effects of them follow our friends
line 3110-->    And show what we alone must think, which never
line 3111-->    Returns us thanks.
line 3112-->
line 3113-->                      Enter PAGE
line 3114-->
line 3115-->  PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.      Exit PAGE  
line 3116-->  PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will
line 3117-->    think of thee at court.
line 3118-->  HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
line 3119-->  PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.
line 3120-->  HELENA. I especially think, under Mars.
line 3121-->  PAROLLES. Why under Man?
line 3122-->  HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
line 3123-->    under Mars.
line 3124-->  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.
line 3125-->  HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
line 3126-->  PAROLLES. Why think you so?
line 3127-->  HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.
line 3128-->  PAROLLES. That's for advantage.
line 3129-->  HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the
line 3130-->    composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
line 3131-->    a good wing, and I like the wear well.
line 3132-->  PAROLLES. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I
line 3133-->    will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall
line 3134-->    serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
line 3135-->    counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else  
line 3136-->    thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes
line 3137-->    thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;
line 3138-->    when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good
line 3139-->    husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.
line 3140--> Exit
line 3141-->  HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
line 3142-->    Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
line 3143-->    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
line 3144-->    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
line 3145-->    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
line 3146-->    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
line 3147-->    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
line 3148-->    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
line 3149-->    Impossible be strange attempts to those
line 3150-->    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
line 3151-->    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
line 3152-->    To show her merit that did miss her love?
line 3153-->    The King's disease-my project may deceive me,
line 3154-->    But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me.        Exit

line 3158-->
line 3159-->ACT I. SCENE 2.
line 3160-->Paris. The KING'S palace
line 3161-->
line 3162-->Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with letters,
line 3163-->and divers ATTENDANTS
line 3164-->
line 3165-->  KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;
line 3166-->    Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
line 3167-->    A braving war.
line 3168-->  FIRST LORD. So 'tis reported, sir.
line 3169-->  KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it,
line 3170-->    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
line 3171-->    With caution, that the Florentine will move us
line 3172-->    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
line 3173-->    Prejudicates the business, and would seem
line 3174-->    To have us make denial.
line 3175-->  FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom,
line 3176-->    Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead
line 3177-->    For amplest credence.
line 3178-->  KING. He hath arm'd our answer,
line 3179-->    And Florence is denied before he comes;
line 3180-->    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see  
line 3181-->    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
line 3182-->    To stand on either part.
line 3183-->  SECOND LORD. It well may serve
line 3184-->    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
line 3185-->    For breathing and exploit.
line 3186-->  KING. What's he comes here?
line 3187-->
line 3188-->              Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
line 3189-->
line 3190-->  FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
line 3191-->    Young Bertram.
line 3192-->  KING. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
line 3193-->    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
line 3194-->    Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts
line 3195-->    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
line 3196-->  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.
line 3197-->  KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now,
line 3198-->    As when thy father and myself in friendship
line 3199-->    First tried our soldiership. He did look far
line 3200-->    Into the service of the time, and was  
line 3201-->    Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;
line 3202-->    But on us both did haggish age steal on,
line 3203-->    And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
line 3204-->    To talk of your good father. In his youth
line 3205-->    He had the wit which I can well observe
line 3206-->    To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
line 3207-->    Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
line 3208-->    Ere they can hide their levity in honour.
line 3209-->    So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
line 3210-->    Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
line 3211-->    His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,
line 3212-->    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
line 3213-->    Exception bid him speak, and at this time
line 3214-->    His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him
line 3215-->    He us'd as creatures of another place;
line 3216-->    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
line 3217-->    Making them proud of his humility
line 3218-->    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
line 3219-->    Might be a copy to these younger times;
line 3220-->    Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now  
line 3221-->    But goers backward.
line 3222-->  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,
line 3223-->    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
line 3224-->    So in approof lives not his epitaph
line 3225-->    As in your royal speech.
line 3226-->  KING. Would I were with him! He would always say-
line 3227-->    Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
line 3228-->    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them
line 3229-->    To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-
line 3230-->    This his good melancholy oft began,
line 3231-->    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
line 3232-->    When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he
line 3233-->    'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
line 3234-->    Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
line 3235-->    All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
line 3236-->    Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
line 3237-->    Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd.
line 3238-->    I, after him, do after him wish too,
line 3239-->    Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
line 3240-->    I quickly were dissolved from my hive,  
line 3241-->    To give some labourers room.
line 3242-->  SECOND LORD. You're loved, sir;
line 3243-->    They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
line 3244-->  KING. I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, Count,
line 3245-->    Since the physician at your father's died?
line 3246-->    He was much fam'd.
line 3247-->  BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.
line 3248-->  KING. If he were living, I would try him yet-
line 3249-->    Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out
line 3250-->    With several applications. Nature and sickness
line 3251-->    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;
line 3252-->    My son's no dearer.
line 3253-->  BERTRAM. Thank your Majesty.                 Exeunt [Flourish]
line 3254-->
line 3255-->
line 3256-->
line 3257-->
line 3258-->ACT I. SCENE 3.
line 3259-->Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
line 3260-->
line 3261-->Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN
line 3262-->
line 3263-->  COUNTESS. I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
line 3264-->  STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish
line 3265-->    might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we
line 3266-->    wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings,
line 3267-->    when of ourselves we publish them.
line 3268-->  COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The
line 3269-->    complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my
line 3270-->    slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit
line 3271-->    them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.
line 3272-->  CLOWN. 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
line 3273-->  COUNTESS. Well, sir.
line 3274-->  CLOWN. No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of
line 3275-->    the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's good will
line 3276-->    to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
line 3277-->  COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
line 3278-->  CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.
line 3279-->  COUNTESS. In what case?  
line 3280-->  CLOWN. In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I
line 3281-->    think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o'
line 3282-->    my body; for they say bames are blessings.
line 3283-->  COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
line 3284-->  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the
line 3285-->    flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
line 3286-->  COUNTESS. Is this all your worship's reason?
line 3287-->  CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.
line 3288-->  COUNTESS. May the world know them?
line 3289-->  CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh
line 3290-->    and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
line 3291-->  COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
line 3292-->  CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for
line 3293-->    my wife's sake.
line 3294-->  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
line 3295-->  CLOWN. Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come
line 3296-->    to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land
line 3297-->    spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his
line 3298-->    cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the
line 3299-->    cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and  
line 3300-->    blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood
line 3301-->    is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men
line 3302-->    could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in
line 3303-->    marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the
line 3304-->    papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their
line 3305-->    heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer
line 3306-->    i' th' herd.
line 3307-->  COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave?
line 3308-->  CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:
line 3309-->
line 3310-->              For I the ballad will repeat,
line 3311-->                Which men full true shall find:
line 3312-->              Your marriage comes by destiny,
line 3313-->                Your cuckoo sings by kind.
line 3314-->
line 3315-->  COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
line 3316-->  STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you.
line 3317-->    Of her I am to speak.
line 3318-->  COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen
line 3319-->    I mean.  
line 3320-->  CLOWN.  [Sings]
line 3321-->
line 3322-->               'Was this fair face the cause' quoth she
line 3323-->                 'Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
line 3324-->               Fond done, done fond,
line 3325-->                 Was this King Priam's joy?'
line 3326-->               With that she sighed as she stood,
line 3327-->               With that she sighed as she stood,
line 3328-->                 And gave this sentence then:
line 3329-->               'Among nine bad if one be good,
line 3330-->               Among nine bad if one be good,
line 3331-->                 There's yet one good in ten.'
line 3332-->
line 3333-->  COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
line 3334-->  CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th'
line 3335-->    song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We'd find
line 3336-->    no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten,
line 3337-->    quoth 'a! An we might have a good woman born before every blazing
line 3338-->    star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man
line 3339-->    may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one.
line 3340-->  COUNTESS. You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.  
line 3341-->  CLOWN. That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done!
line 3342-->    Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will
line 3343-->    wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart.
line 3344-->    I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.
line 3345--> Exit
line 3346-->  COUNTESS. Well, now.
line 3347-->  STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
line 3348-->  COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she
line 3349-->    herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as
line 3350-->    much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and
line 3351-->    more shall be paid her than she'll demand.
line 3352-->  STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she
line 3353-->    wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own
line 3354-->    words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they
line 3355-->    touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your
line 3356-->    son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such
line 3357-->    difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not
line 3358-->    extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen
line 3359-->    of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without
line 3360-->    rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she  
line 3361-->    deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard
line 3362-->    virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you
line 3363-->    withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you
line 3364-->    something to know it.
line 3365-->  COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself.
line 3366-->    Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before, which hung so
line 3367-->    tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor
line 3368-->    misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I
line 3369-->    thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further
line 3370-->    anon.                                           Exit STEWARD
line 3371-->
line 3372-->                            Enter HELENA
line 3373-->
line 3374-->    Even so it was with me when I was young.
line 3375-->    If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
line 3376-->    Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
line 3377-->    Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.
line 3378-->    It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
line 3379-->    Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.
line 3380-->    By our remembrances of days foregone,  
line 3381-->    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
line 3382-->    Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.
line 3383-->  HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?
line 3384-->  COUNTESS. You know, Helen,
line 3385-->    I am a mother to you.
line 3386-->  HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.
line 3387-->  COUNTESS. Nay, a mother.
line 3388-->    Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
line 3389-->    Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother'
line 3390-->    That you start at it? I say I am your mother,
line 3391-->    And put you in the catalogue of those
line 3392-->    That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen
line 3393-->    Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
line 3394-->    A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
line 3395-->    You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
line 3396-->    Yet I express to you a mother's care.
line 3397-->    God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
line 3398-->    To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
line 3399-->    That this distempered messenger of wet,
line 3400-->    The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?  
line 3401-->    Why, that you are my daughter?
line 3402-->  HELENA. That I am not.
line 3403-->  COUNTESS. I say I am your mother.
line 3404-->  HELENA. Pardon, madam.
line 3405-->    The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
line 3406-->    I am from humble, he from honoured name;
line 3407-->    No note upon my parents, his all noble.
line 3408-->    My master, my dear lord he is; and I
line 3409-->    His servant live, and will his vassal die.
line 3410-->    He must not be my brother.
line 3411-->  COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?
line 3412-->  HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were-
line 3413-->    So that my lord your son were not my brother-
line 3414-->    Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,
line 3415-->    I care no more for than I do for heaven,
line 3416-->    So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
line 3417-->    But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
line 3418-->  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
line 3419-->    God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'
line 3420-->    So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?  
line 3421-->    My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see
line 3422-->    The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find
line 3423-->    Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross
line 3424-->    You love my son; invention is asham'd,
line 3425-->    Against the proclamation of thy passion,
line 3426-->    To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;
line 3427-->    But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks
line 3428-->    Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
line 3429-->    See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
line 3430-->    That in their kind they speak it; only sin
line 3431-->    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
line 3432-->    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
line 3433-->    If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
line 3434-->    If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,
line 3435-->    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
line 3436-->    To tell me truly.
line 3437-->  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.
line 3438-->  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?
line 3439-->  HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.
line 3440-->  COUNTESS. Love you my son?  
line 3441-->  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?
line 3442-->  COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in't a bond
line 3443-->    Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose
line 3444-->    The state of your affection; for your passions
line 3445-->    Have to the full appeach'd.
line 3446-->  HELENA. Then I confess,
line 3447-->    Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
line 3448-->    That before you, and next unto high heaven,
line 3449-->    I love your son.
line 3450-->    My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.
line 3451-->    Be not offended, for it hurts not him
line 3452-->    That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not
line 3453-->    By any token of presumptuous suit,
line 3454-->    Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
line 3455-->    Yet never know how that desert should be.
line 3456-->    I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
line 3457-->    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
line 3458-->    I still pour in the waters of my love,
line 3459-->    And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
line 3460-->    Religious in mine error, I adore  
line 3461-->    The sun that looks upon his worshipper
line 3462-->    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
line 3463-->    Let not your hate encounter with my love,
line 3464-->    For loving where you do; but if yourself,
line 3465-->    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
line 3466-->    Did ever in so true a flame of liking
line 3467-->    Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
line 3468-->    Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity
line 3469-->    To her whose state is such that cannot choose
line 3470-->    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
line 3471-->    That seeks not to find that her search implies,
line 3472-->    But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!
line 3473-->  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent-speak truly-
line 3474-->    To go to Paris?
line 3475-->  HELENA. Madam, I had.
line 3476-->  COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.
line 3477-->  HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
line 3478-->    You know my father left me some prescriptions
line 3479-->    Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading
line 3480-->    And manifest experience had collected  
line 3481-->    For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
line 3482-->    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
line 3483-->    As notes whose faculties inclusive were
line 3484-->    More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
line 3485-->    There is a remedy, approv'd, set down,
line 3486-->    To cure the desperate languishings whereof
line 3487-->    The King is render'd lost.
line 3488-->  COUNTESS. This was your motive
line 3489-->    For Paris, was it? Speak.
line 3490-->  HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this,
line 3491-->    Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
line 3492-->    Had from the conversation of my thoughts
line 3493-->    Haply been absent then.
line 3494-->  COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,
line 3495-->    If you should tender your supposed aid,
line 3496-->    He would receive it? He and his physicians
line 3497-->    Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;
line 3498-->    They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
line 3499-->    A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
line 3500-->    Embowell'd of their doctrine, have let off  
line 3501-->    The danger to itself?
line 3502-->  HELENA. There's something in't
line 3503-->    More than my father's skill, which was the great'st
line 3504-->    Of his profession, that his good receipt
line 3505-->    Shall for my legacy be sanctified
line 3506-->    By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour
line 3507-->    But give me leave to try success, I'd venture
line 3508-->    The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.
line 3509-->    By such a day and hour.
line 3510-->  COUNTESS. Dost thou believe't?
line 3511-->  HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.
line 3512-->  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
line 3513-->    Means and attendants, and my loving greetings
line 3514-->    To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home,
line 3515-->    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
line 3516-->    Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
line 3517-->    What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.          Exeunt

line 3533-->ACT II. SCENE 1.
line 3534-->Paris. The KING'S palace
line 3535-->
line 3536-->Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leave
line 3537-->for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS
line 3538-->
line 3539-->  KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles
line 3540-->    Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;
line 3541-->    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
line 3542-->    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,
line 3543-->    And is enough for both.
line 3544-->  FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir,
line 3545-->    After well-ent'red soldiers, to return
line 3546-->    And find your Grace in health.
line 3547-->  KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
line 3548-->    Will not confess he owes the malady
line 3549-->    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
line 3550-->    Whether I live or die, be you the sons
line 3551-->    Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-
line 3552-->    Those bated that inherit but the fall
line 3553-->    Of the last monarchy-see that you come  
line 3554-->    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
line 3555-->    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
line 3556-->    That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.
line 3557-->  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!
line 3558-->  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;
line 3559-->    They say our French lack language to deny,
line 3560-->    If they demand; beware of being captives
line 3561-->    Before you serve.
line 3562-->    BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.
line 3563-->  KING. Farewell.  [To ATTENDANTS]  Come hither to me.
line 3564-->                                       The KING retires attended
line 3565-->  FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
line 3566-->  PAROLLES. 'Tis not his fault, the spark.
line 3567-->    SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!
line 3568-->  PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.
line 3569-->  BERTRAM. I am commanded here and kept a coil with
line 3570-->    'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
line 3571-->  PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.
line 3572-->  BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
line 3573-->    Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,  
line 3574-->    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn
line 3575-->    But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away.
line 3576-->  FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft.
line 3577-->  PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.
line 3578-->  SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.
line 3579-->  BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.
line 3580-->  FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.
line 3581-->  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
line 3582-->  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and
line 3583-->    lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of
line 3584-->    the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of
line 3585-->    war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
line 3586-->    entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.
line 3587-->  FIRST LORD. We shall, noble Captain.
line 3588-->  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!       Exeunt LORDS
line 3589-->    What will ye do?
line 3590-->
line 3591-->                            Re-enter the KING
line 3592-->
line 3593-->  BERTRAM. Stay; the King!  
line 3594-->  PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have
line 3595-->    restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more
line 3596-->    expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the
line 3597-->    time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the
line 3598-->    influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead
line 3599-->    the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more
line 3600-->    dilated farewell.
line 3601-->  BERTRAM. And I will do so.
line 3602-->  PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
line 3603-->                                     Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES
line 3604-->
line 3605-->                              Enter LAFEU
line 3606-->
line 3607-->  LAFEU.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
line 3608-->  KING. I'll fee thee to stand up.
line 3609-->  LAFEU. Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.
line 3610-->    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;
line 3611-->    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
line 3612-->  KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
line 3613-->    And ask'd thee mercy for't.  
line 3614-->  LAFEU. Good faith, across!
line 3615-->    But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd
line 3616-->    Of your infirmity?
line 3617-->  KING. No.
line 3618-->  LAFEU. O, will you eat
line 3619-->    No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
line 3620-->    My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
line 3621-->    Could reach them: I have seen a medicine
line 3622-->    That's able to breathe life into a stone,
line 3623-->    Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
line 3624-->    With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch
line 3625-->    Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
line 3626-->    To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand
line 3627-->    And write to her a love-line.
line 3628-->  KING. What her is this?
line 3629-->  LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,
line 3630-->    If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,
line 3631-->    If seriously I may convey my thoughts
line 3632-->    In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
line 3633-->    With one that in her sex, her years, profession,  
line 3634-->    Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more
line 3635-->    Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,
line 3636-->    For that is her demand, and know her business?
line 3637-->    That done, laugh well at me.
line 3638-->  KING. Now, good Lafeu,
line 3639-->    Bring in the admiration, that we with the
line 3640-->    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
line 3641-->    By wond'ring how thou took'st it.
line 3642-->  LAFEU. Nay, I'll fit you,
line 3643-->    And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU
line 3644-->  KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
line 3645-->
line 3646-->                   Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA
line 3647-->
line 3648-->  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.
line 3649-->  KING. This haste hath wings indeed.
line 3650-->  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;
line 3651-->    This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.
line 3652-->    A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
line 3653-->    His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,  
line 3654-->    That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit
line 3655-->  KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
line 3656-->  HELENA. Ay, my good lord.
line 3657-->    Gerard de Narbon was my father,
line 3658-->    In what he did profess, well found.
line 3659-->  KING. I knew him.
line 3660-->  HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
line 3661-->    Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
line 3662-->    Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
line 3663-->    Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
line 3664-->    And of his old experience th' only darling,
line 3665-->    He bade me store up as a triple eye,
line 3666-->    Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:
line 3667-->    And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd
line 3668-->    With that malignant cause wherein the honour
line 3669-->    Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
line 3670-->    I come to tender it, and my appliance,
line 3671-->    With all bound humbleness.
line 3672-->  KING. We thank you, maiden;
line 3673-->    But may not be so credulous of cure,  
line 3674-->    When our most learned doctors leave us, and
line 3675-->    The congregated college have concluded
line 3676-->    That labouring art can never ransom nature
line 3677-->    From her inaidable estate-I say we must not
line 3678-->    So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
line 3679-->    To prostitute our past-cure malady
line 3680-->    To empirics; or to dissever so
line 3681-->    Our great self and our credit to esteem
line 3682-->    A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
line 3683-->  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
line 3684-->    I will no more enforce mine office on you;
line 3685-->    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
line 3686-->    A modest one to bear me back again.
line 3687-->  KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
line 3688-->    Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
line 3689-->    As one near death to those that wish him live.
line 3690-->    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;
line 3691-->    I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
line 3692-->  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,
line 3693-->    Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.  
line 3694-->    He that of greatest works is finisher
line 3695-->    Oft does them by the weakest minister.
line 3696-->    So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
line 3697-->    When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown
line 3698-->    From simple sources, and great seas have dried
line 3699-->    When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
line 3700-->    Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
line 3701-->    Where most it promises; and oft it hits
line 3702-->    Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.
line 3703-->  KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;
line 3704-->    Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;
line 3705-->    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
line 3706-->  HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.
line 3707-->    It is not so with Him that all things knows,
line 3708-->    As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
line 3709-->    But most it is presumption in us when
line 3710-->    The help of heaven we count the act of men.
line 3711-->    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
line 3712-->    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
line 3713-->    I am not an impostor, that proclaim  
line 3714-->    Myself against the level of mine aim;
line 3715-->    But know I think, and think I know most sure,
line 3716-->    My art is not past power nor you past cure.
line 3717-->  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space
line 3718-->    Hop'st thou my cure?
line 3719-->  HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.
line 3720-->    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
line 3721-->    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
line 3722-->    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
line 3723-->    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
line 3724-->    Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
line 3725-->    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
line 3726-->    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
line 3727-->    Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.
line 3728-->  KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence
line 3729-->    What dar'st thou venture?
line 3730-->  HELENA. Tax of impudence,
line 3731-->    A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
line 3732-->    Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name
line 3733-->    Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended  
line 3734-->    With vilest torture let my life be ended.
line 3735-->  KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
line 3736-->    His powerful sound within an organ weak;
line 3737-->    And what impossibility would slay
line 3738-->    In common sense, sense saves another way.
line 3739-->    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
line 3740-->    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
line 3741-->    Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
line 3742-->    That happiness and prime can happy call.
line 3743-->    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
line 3744-->    Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
line 3745-->    Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
line 3746-->    That ministers thine own death if I die.
line 3747-->  HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property
line 3748-->    Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;
line 3749-->    And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;
line 3750-->    But, if I help, what do you promise me?
line 3751-->  KING. Make thy demand.
line 3752-->  HELENA. But will you make it even?
line 3753-->  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.  
line 3754-->  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
line 3755-->    What husband in thy power I will command.
line 3756-->    Exempted be from me the arrogance
line 3757-->    To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
line 3758-->    My low and humble name to propagate
line 3759-->    With any branch or image of thy state;
line 3760-->    But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
line 3761-->    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
line 3762-->  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
line 3763-->    Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd.
line 3764-->    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
line 3765-->    Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.
line 3766-->    More should I question thee, and more I must,
line 3767-->    Though more to know could not be more to trust,
line 3768-->    From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest
line 3769-->    Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
line 3770-->    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
line 3771-->    As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
line 3772-->                                              [Flourish. Exeunt]

line 3777-->ACT II. SCENE 2.
line 3778-->Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
line 3779-->
line 3780-->Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN
line 3781-->
line 3782-->  COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your
line 3783-->    breeding.
line 3784-->  CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my
line 3785-->    business is but to the court.
line 3786-->  COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you
line 3787-->    put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
line 3788-->  CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may
line 3789-->    easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's
line 3790-->    cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip,
line 3791-->    nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for
line 3792-->    the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.
line 3793-->  COUNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.
line 3794-->  CLOWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin
line 3795-->    buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.
line 3796-->  COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
line 3797-->  CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your
line 3798-->    French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's
line 3799-->    forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for Mayday,
line 3800-->    as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding
line 3801-->    quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's
line 3802-->    mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.
line 3803-->  COUNTESS. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all
line 3804-->    questions?
line 3805-->  CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit
line 3806-->    any question.
line 3807-->  COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit
line 3808-->    all demands.
line 3809-->  CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should
line 3810-->    speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me
line 3811-->    if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.
line 3812-->  COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in
line 3813-->    question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir,
line 3814-->    are you a courtier?
line 3815-->  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a
line 3816-->    hundred of them.
line 3817-->  COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
line 3818-->  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.  
line 3819-->  COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
line 3820-->  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
line 3821-->  COUNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.
line 3822-->  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.
line 3823-->  COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare
line 3824-->    not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your
line 3825-->    whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were
line 3826-->    but bound to't.
line 3827-->  CLOWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see
line 3828-->    thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.
line 3829-->  COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time,
line 3830-->    To entertain it so merrily with a fool.
line 3831-->  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.
line 3832-->  COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this,
line 3833-->    And urge her to a present answer back;
line 3834-->    Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.
line 3835-->  CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?
line 3836-->  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?
line 3837-->  CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.
line 3838-->  COUNTESS. Haste you again.                              Exeunt

line 3843-->ACT II. SCENE 3.
line 3844-->Paris. The KING'S palace
line 3845-->
line 3846-->Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
line 3847-->
line 3848-->  LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
line 3849-->    persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
line 3850-->    causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
line 3851-->    ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
line 3852-->    ourselves to an unknown fear.
line 3853-->  PAROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot
line 3854-->    out in our latter times.
line 3855-->  BERTRAM. And so 'tis.
line 3856-->  LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists-
line 3857-->  PAROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.
line 3858-->  LAFEU. Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
line 3859-->  PAROLLES. Right; so I say.
line 3860-->  LAFEU. That gave him out incurable-
line 3861-->  PAROLLES. Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
line 3862-->  LAFEU. Not to be help'd-
line 3863-->  PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-
line 3864-->  LAFEU. Uncertain life and sure death.  
line 3865-->  PAROLLES. Just; you say well; so would I have said.
line 3866-->  LAFEU. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.
line 3867-->  PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall
line 3868-->    read it in what-do-ye-call't here.
line 3869-->  LAFEU.  [Reading the ballad title]  'A Showing of a Heavenly
line 3870-->    Effect in an Earthly Actor.'
line 3871-->  PAROLLES. That's it; I would have said the very same.
line 3872-->  LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in
line 3873-->    respect-
line 3874-->  PAROLLES. Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief
line 3875-->    and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that
line 3876-->    will not acknowledge it to be the-
line 3877-->  LAFEU. Very hand of heaven.
line 3878-->  PAROLLES. Ay; so I say.
line 3879-->  LAFEU. In a most weak-
line 3880-->  PAROLLES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence;
line 3881-->    which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone
line 3882-->    the recov'ry of the King, as to be-
line 3883-->  LAFEU. Generally thankful.
line 3884-->  
line 3885-->                 Enter KING, HELENA, and ATTENDANTS
line 3886-->
line 3887-->  PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.
line 3888-->  LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,
line 3889-->    whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a
line 3890-->    coranto.
line 3891-->  PAROLLES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?
line 3892-->  LAFEU. 'Fore God, I think so.
line 3893-->  KING. Go, call before me all the lords in court.
line 3894-->                                               Exit an ATTENDANT
line 3895-->    Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
line 3896-->    And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
line 3897-->    Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive
line 3898-->    The confirmation of my promis'd gift,
line 3899-->    Which but attends thy naming.
line 3900-->
line 3901-->                     Enter three or four LORDS
line 3902-->
line 3903-->    Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel
line 3904-->    Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,  
line 3905-->    O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
line 3906-->    I have to use. Thy frank election make;
line 3907-->    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
line 3908-->  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
line 3909-->    Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!
line 3910-->  LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
line 3911-->    My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
line 3912-->    And writ as little beard.
line 3913-->  KING. Peruse them well.
line 3914-->    Not one of those but had a noble father.
line 3915-->  HELENA. Gentlemen,
line 3916-->    Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.
line 3917-->  ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
line 3918-->  HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest
line 3919-->    That I protest I simply am a maid.
line 3920-->    Please it your Majesty, I have done already.
line 3921-->    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:
line 3922-->    'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
line 3923-->    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,
line 3924-->    We'll ne'er come there again.'  
line 3925-->  KING. Make choice and see:
line 3926-->    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
line 3927-->  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
line 3928-->    And to imperial Love, that god most high,
line 3929-->    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
line 3930-->  FIRST LORD. And grant it.
line 3931-->  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
line 3932-->  LAFEU. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my
line 3933-->    life.
line 3934-->  HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
line 3935-->    Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.
line 3936-->    Love make your fortunes twenty times above
line 3937-->    Her that so wishes, and her humble love!
line 3938-->  SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.
line 3939-->  HELENA. My wish receive,
line 3940-->    Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.
line 3941-->  LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have
line 3942-->    them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
line 3943-->  HELENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
line 3944-->    I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.  
line 3945-->    Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed
line 3946-->    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
line 3947-->  LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.
line 3948-->    Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.
line 3949-->  HELENA. You are too young, too happy, and too good,
line 3950-->    To make yourself a son out of my blood.
line 3951-->  FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.
line 3952-->  LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but
line 3953-->    if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known
line 3954-->    thee already.
line 3955-->  HELENA.  [To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give
line 3956-->    Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
line 3957-->    Into your guiding power. This is the man.
line 3958-->  KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
line 3959-->  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,
line 3960-->    In such a business give me leave to use
line 3961-->    The help of mine own eyes.
line 3962-->  KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram,
line 3963-->    What she has done for me?
line 3964-->  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;  
line 3965-->    But never hope to know why I should marry her.
line 3966-->  KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
line 3967-->  BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
line 3968-->    Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
line 3969-->    She had her breeding at my father's charge.
line 3970-->    A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
line 3971-->    Rather corrupt me ever!
line 3972-->  KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
line 3973-->    I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
line 3974-->    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
line 3975-->    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
line 3976-->    In differences so mighty. If she be
line 3977-->    All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,
line 3978-->    A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
line 3979-->    Of virtue for the name; but do not so.
line 3980-->    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
line 3981-->    The place is dignified by the doer's deed;
line 3982-->    Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
line 3983-->    It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
line 3984-->    Is good without a name. Vileness is so:  
line 3985-->    The property by what it is should go,
line 3986-->    Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
line 3987-->    In these to nature she's immediate heir;
line 3988-->    And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn
line 3989-->    Which challenges itself as honour's born
line 3990-->    And is not like the sire. Honours thrive
line 3991-->    When rather from our acts we them derive
line 3992-->    Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave,
line 3993-->    Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave
line 3994-->    A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
line 3995-->    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
line 3996-->    Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
line 3997-->    If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
line 3998-->    I can create the rest. Virtue and she
line 3999-->    Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
line 4000-->  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
line 4001-->  KING. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
line 4002-->  HELENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.
line 4003-->    Let the rest go.
line 4004-->  KING. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,  
line 4005-->    I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
line 4006-->    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
line 4007-->    That dost in vile misprision shackle up
line 4008-->    My love and her desert; that canst not dream
line 4009-->    We, poising us in her defective scale,
line 4010-->    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
line 4011-->    It is in us to plant thine honour where
line 4012-->    We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;
line 4013-->    Obey our will, which travails in thy good;
line 4014-->    Believe not thy disdain, but presently
line 4015-->    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
line 4016-->    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
line 4017-->    Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
line 4018-->    Into the staggers and the careless lapse
line 4019-->    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
line 4020-->    Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,
line 4021-->    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
line 4022-->  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
line 4023-->    My fancy to your eyes. When I consider
line 4024-->    What great creation and what dole of honour  
line 4025-->    Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late
line 4026-->    Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
line 4027-->    The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,
line 4028-->    Is as 'twere born so.
line 4029-->  KING. Take her by the hand,
line 4030-->    And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
line 4031-->    A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
line 4032-->    A balance more replete.
line 4033-->  BERTRAM. I take her hand.
line 4034-->  KING. Good fortune and the favour of the King
line 4035-->    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
line 4036-->    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
line 4037-->    And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast
line 4038-->    Shall more attend upon the coming space,
line 4039-->    Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,
line 4040-->    Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
line 4041-->              Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind,
line 4042-->                                      commenting of this wedding
line 4043-->  LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
line 4044-->  PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir?  
line 4045-->  LAFEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
line 4046-->  PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!
line 4047-->  LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak?
line 4048-->  PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
line 4049-->    succeeding. My master!
line 4050-->  LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
line 4051-->  PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
line 4052-->  LAFEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
line 4053-->  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
line 4054-->    old.
line 4055-->  LAFEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age
line 4056-->    cannot bring thee.
line 4057-->  PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
line 4058-->  LAFEU. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise
line 4059-->    fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might
line 4060-->    pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
line 4061-->    dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I
line 4062-->    have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art
line 4063-->    thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce
line 4064-->    worth.  
line 4065-->  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
line 4066-->  LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
line 4067-->    trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good
line 4068-->    window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open,
line 4069-->    for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.
line 4070-->  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
line 4071-->  LAFEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
line 4072-->  PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.
line 4073-->  LAFEU. Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee
line 4074-->    a scruple.
line 4075-->  PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.
line 4076-->  LAFEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
line 4077-->    o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
line 4078-->    beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I
line 4079-->    have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my
line 4080-->    knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.'
line 4081-->  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
line 4082-->  LAFEU. I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing
line 4083-->    eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion
line 4084-->    age will give me leave.                                 Exit  
line 4085-->  PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:
line 4086-->    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there
line 4087-->    is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can
line 4088-->    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a
line 4089-->    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-
line 4090-->    I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.
line 4091-->
line 4092-->                         Re-enter LAFEU
line 4093-->
line 4094-->  LAFEU. Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for
line 4095-->    you; you have a new mistress.
line 4096-->  PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
line 4097-->    reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve
line 4098-->    above is my master.
line 4099-->  LAFEU. Who? God?
line 4100-->  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.
line 4101-->  LAFEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up
line 4102-->    thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other
line 4103-->    servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose
line 4104-->    stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat  
line 4105-->    thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should
line 4106-->    beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe
line 4107-->    themselves upon thee.
line 4108-->  PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
line 4109-->  LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel
line 4110-->    out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;
line 4111-->    you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
line 4112-->    commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are
line 4113-->    not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.
line 4114--> Exit
line 4115-->
line 4116-->                           Enter BERTRAM
line 4117-->
line 4118-->  PAROLLES. Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it
line 4119-->    be conceal'd awhile.
line 4120-->  BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
line 4121-->  PAROLLES. What's the matter, sweetheart?
line 4122-->  BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
line 4123-->    I will not bed her.
line 4124-->  PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?  
line 4125-->  BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!
line 4126-->    I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
line 4127-->  PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
line 4128-->    The tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!
line 4129-->  BERTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know
line 4130-->    not yet.
line 4131-->  PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'
line 4132-->      wars!
line 4133-->    He wears his honour in a box unseen
line 4134-->    That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
line 4135-->    Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
line 4136-->    Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
line 4137-->    Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!
line 4138-->    France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
line 4139-->    Therefore, to th' war!
line 4140-->  BERTRAM. It shall be so; I'll send her to my house,
line 4141-->    Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
line 4142-->    And wherefore I am fled; write to the King
line 4143-->    That which I durst not speak. His present gift
line 4144-->    Shall furnish me to those Italian fields  
line 4145-->    Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife
line 4146-->    To the dark house and the detested wife.
line 4147-->  PAROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
line 4148-->  BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me.
line 4149-->    I'll send her straight away. To-morrow
line 4150-->    I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
line 4151-->  PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
line 4152-->    A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
line 4153-->    Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.
line 4154-->    The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so.      Exeunt
line 4155-->
line 4156-->
line 4157-->
line 4158-->
line 4159-->ACT II. SCENE 4.
line 4160-->Paris. The KING'S palace
line 4161-->
line 4162-->Enter HELENA and CLOWN
line 4163-->
line 4164-->  HELENA. My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
line 4165-->  CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very
line 4166-->    merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very
line 4167-->    well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not well.
line 4168-->  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very
line 4169-->    well?
line 4170-->  CLOWN. Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
line 4171-->  HELENA. What two things?
line 4172-->  CLOWN. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly!
line 4173-->    The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!
line 4174-->
line 4175-->                        Enter PAROLLES
line 4176-->
line 4177-->  PAROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!
line 4178-->  HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good
line 4179-->    fortunes.
line 4180-->  PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on,  
line 4181-->    have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
line 4182-->  CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she
line 4183-->    did as you say.
line 4184-->  PAROLLES. Why, I say nothing.
line 4185-->  CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes
line 4186-->    out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know
line 4187-->    nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your
line 4188-->    title, which is within a very little of nothing.
line 4189-->  PAROLLES. Away! th'art a knave.
line 4190-->  CLOWN. You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave';
line 4191-->    that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir.
line 4192-->  PAROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
line 4193-->  CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find
line 4194-->    me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find
line 4195-->    in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of
line 4196-->    laughter.
line 4197-->  PAROLLES. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
line 4198-->    Madam, my lord will go away to-night:
line 4199-->    A very serious business calls on him.
line 4200-->    The great prerogative and rite of love,  
line 4201-->    Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
line 4202-->    But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
line 4203-->    Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
line 4204-->    Which they distil now in the curbed time,
line 4205-->    To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
line 4206-->    And pleasure drown the brim.
line 4207-->  HELENA. What's his else?
line 4208-->  PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o' th' King,
line 4209-->    And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
line 4210-->    Strength'ned with what apology you think
line 4211-->    May make it probable need.
line 4212-->  HELENA. What more commands he?
line 4213-->  PAROLLES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently
line 4214-->    Attend his further pleasure.
line 4215-->  HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.
line 4216-->  PAROLLES. I shall report it so.
line 4217-->  HELENA. I pray you.                              Exit PAROLLES
line 4218-->    Come, sirrah.                                         Exeunt
line 4219-->
line 4220-->
line 4221-->
line 4222-->
line 4223-->ACT II. SCENE 5.
line 4224-->Paris. The KING'S palace
line 4225-->
line 4226-->Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM
line 4227-->
line 4228-->  LAFEU. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
line 4229-->  BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
line 4230-->  LAFEU. You have it from his own deliverance.
line 4231-->  BERTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.
line 4232-->  LAFEU. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.
line 4233-->  BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
line 4234-->    and accordingly valiant.
line 4235-->  LAFEU. I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
line 4236-->    against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I
line 4237-->    cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you
line 4238-->    make us friends; I will pursue the amity
line 4239-->
line 4240-->                         Enter PAROLLES
line 4241-->
line 4242-->  PAROLLES.  [To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
line 4243-->  LAFEU. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
line 4244-->  PAROLLES. Sir!  
line 4245-->  LAFEU. O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a
line 4246-->    very good tailor.
line 4247-->  BERTRAM.  [Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the King?
line 4248-->  PAROLLES. She is.
line 4249-->  BERTRAM. Will she away to-night?
line 4250-->  PAROLLES. As you'll have her.
line 4251-->  BERTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
line 4252-->    Given order for our horses; and to-night,
line 4253-->    When I should take possession of the bride,
line 4254-->    End ere I do begin.
line 4255-->  LAFEU. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
line 4256-->    but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a
line 4257-->    thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.
line 4258-->    God save you, Captain.
line 4259-->  BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
line 4260-->  PAROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
line 4261-->    displeasure.
line 4262-->  LAFEU. You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
line 4263-->    like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run
line 4264-->    again, rather than suffer question for your residence.  
line 4265-->  BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
line 4266-->  LAFEU. And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers.
line 4267-->    Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no
line 4268-->    kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
line 4269-->    trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
line 4270-->    tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken
line 4271-->    better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
line 4272-->    must do good against evil.                              Exit
line 4273-->  PAROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.
line 4274-->  BERTRAM. I think so.
line 4275-->  PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?
line 4276-->  BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech
line 4277-->    Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
line 4278-->
line 4279-->                          Enter HELENA
line 4280-->
line 4281-->  HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
line 4282-->    Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave
line 4283-->    For present parting; only he desires
line 4284-->    Some private speech with you.  
line 4285-->  BERTRAM. I shall obey his will.
line 4286-->    You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
line 4287-->    Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
line 4288-->    The ministration and required office
line 4289-->    On my particular. Prepar'd I was not
line 4290-->    For such a business; therefore am I found
line 4291-->    So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
line 4292-->    That presently you take your way for home,
line 4293-->    And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
line 4294-->    For my respects are better than they seem,
line 4295-->    And my appointments have in them a need
line 4296-->    Greater than shows itself at the first view
line 4297-->    To you that know them not. This to my mother.
line 4298-->                                               [Giving a letter]
line 4299-->    'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
line 4300-->    I leave you to your wisdom.
line 4301-->  HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say
line 4302-->    But that I am your most obedient servant.
line 4303-->  BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.
line 4304-->  HELENA. And ever shall  
line 4305-->    With true observance seek to eke out that
line 4306-->    Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
line 4307-->    To equal my great fortune.
line 4308-->  BERTRAM. Let that go.
line 4309-->    My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.
line 4310-->  HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.
line 4311-->  BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?
line 4312-->  HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
line 4313-->    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
line 4314-->    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
line 4315-->    What law does vouch mine own.
line 4316-->  BERTRAM. What would you have?
line 4317-->  HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.
line 4318-->    I would not tell you what I would, my lord.
line 4319-->    Faith, yes:
line 4320-->    Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.
line 4321-->  BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
line 4322-->  HELENA. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
line 4323-->  BERTRAM. Where are my other men, monsieur?
line 4324-->    Farewell!                                        Exit HELENA  
line 4325-->    Go thou toward home, where I will never come
line 4326-->    Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
line 4327-->    Away, and for our flight.
line 4328-->  PAROLLES. Bravely, coragio!                             Exeunt

line 4345-->Florence. The DUKE's palace
line 4346-->
line 4347-->        Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, attended; two
line 4348-->               FRENCH LORDS, with a TROOP OF SOLDIERS
line 4349-->
line 4350-->  DUKE. So that, from point to point, now have you hear
line 4351-->    The fundamental reasons of this war;
line 4352-->    Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
line 4353-->    And more thirsts after.
line 4354-->  FIRST LORD. Holy seems the quarrel
line 4355-->    Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful
line 4356-->    On the opposer.
line 4357-->  DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
line 4358-->    Would in so just a business shut his bosom
line 4359-->    Against our borrowing prayers.
line 4360-->  SECOND LORD. Good my lord,
line 4361-->    The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
line 4362-->    But like a common and an outward man
line 4363-->    That the great figure of a council frames
line 4364-->    By self-unable motion; therefore dare not
line 4365-->    Say what I think of it, since I have found  
line 4366-->    Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
line 4367-->    As often as I guess'd.
line 4368-->  DUKE. Be it his pleasure.
line 4369-->  FIRST LORD. But I am sure the younger of our nature,
line 4370-->    That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
line 4371-->    Come here for physic.
line 4372-->  DUKE. Welcome shall they be
line 4373-->    And all the honours that can fly from us
line 4374-->    Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
line 4375-->    When better fall, for your avails they fell.
line 4376-->    To-morrow to th' field. Flourish.                     Exeunt
line 4377-->
line 4378-->
line 4379-->
line 4380-->
line 4381-->ACT III. SCENE 2.
line 4382-->Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
line 4383-->
line 4384-->Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN
line 4385-->
line 4386-->  COUNTESS. It hath happen'd all as I would have had it, save that he
line 4387-->    comes not along with her.
line 4388-->  CLOWN. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy
line 4389-->    man.
line 4390-->  COUNTESS. By what observance, I pray you?
line 4391-->  CLOWN. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and
line 4392-->    sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a
line 4393-->    man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a
line 4394-->    song.
line 4395-->  COUNTESS. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
line 4396-->                                              [Opening a letter]
line 4397-->  CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling
line 4398-->    and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and
line 4399-->    your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out;
line 4400-->    and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
line 4401-->  COUNTESS. What have we here?
line 4402-->  CLOWN. E'en that you have there.                          Exit  
line 4403-->  COUNTESS.  [Reads]  'I have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath
line 4404-->    recovered the King and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded
line 4405-->    her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal. You shall hear I am run
line 4406-->    away; know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough
line 4407-->    in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.
line 4408-->                                           Your unfortunate son,
line 4409-->                                                       BERTRAM.'
line 4410-->    This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
line 4411-->    To fly the favours of so good a king,
line 4412-->    To pluck his indignation on thy head
line 4413-->    By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
line 4414-->    For the contempt of empire.
line 4415-->
line 4416-->                           Re-enter CLOWN
line 4417-->
line 4418-->  CLOWN. O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers
line 4419-->    and my young lady.
line 4420-->  COUNTESS. What is the -matter?
line 4421-->  CLOWN. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your
line 4422-->    son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would.  
line 4423-->  COUNTESS. Why should he be kill'd?
line 4424-->  CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the
line 4425-->    danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be
line 4426-->    the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my
line 4427-->    part, I only hear your son was run away.                Exit
line 4428-->
line 4429-->              Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN
line 4430-->
line 4431-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Save you, good madam.
line 4432-->  HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
line 4433-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.
line 4434-->  COUNTESS. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen-
line 4435-->    I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
line 4436-->    That the first face of neither, on the start,
line 4437-->    Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?
line 4438-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.
line 4439-->    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
line 4440-->    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
line 4441-->    Thither we bend again.
line 4442-->  HELENA. Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.  
line 4443-->    [Reads]  'When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which
line 4444-->    never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body
line 4445-->    that I am father to, then call me husband; but in such a "then" I
line 4446-->    write a "never."
line 4447-->    This is a dreadful sentence.
line 4448-->  COUNTESS. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
line 4449-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam;
line 4450-->    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
line 4451-->  COUNTESS. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
line 4452-->    If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
line 4453-->    Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;
line 4454-->    But I do wash his name out of my blood,
line 4455-->    And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
line 4456-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.
line 4457-->  COUNTESS. And to be a soldier?
line 4458-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't,
line 4459-->    The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
line 4460-->    That good convenience claims.
line 4461-->  COUNTESS. Return you thither?
line 4462-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.  
line 4463-->  HELENA.  [Reads]  'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
line 4464-->    'Tis bitter.
line 4465-->  COUNTESS. Find you that there?
line 4466-->  HELENA. Ay, madam.
line 4467-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which
line 4468-->    his heart was not consenting to.
line 4469-->  COUNTESS. Nothing in France until he have no wife!
line 4470-->    There's nothing here that is too good for him
line 4471-->    But only she; and she deserves a lord
line 4472-->    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,
line 4473-->    And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
line 4474-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman
line 4475-->    Which I have sometime known.
line 4476-->  COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?
line 4477-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.
line 4478-->  COUNTESS. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
line 4479-->    My son corrupts a well-derived nature
line 4480-->    With his inducement.
line 4481-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Indeed, good lady,
line 4482-->    The fellow has a deal of that too much  
line 4483-->    Which holds him much to have.
line 4484-->  COUNTESS. Y'are welcome, gentlemen.
line 4485-->    I will entreat you, when you see my son,
line 4486-->    To tell him that his sword can never win
line 4487-->    The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you
line 4488-->    Written to bear along.
line 4489-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam,
line 4490-->    In that and all your worthiest affairs.
line 4491-->  COUNTESS. Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
line 4492-->    Will you draw near?            Exeunt COUNTESS and GENTLEMEN
line 4493-->  HELENA. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
line 4494-->    Nothing in France until he has no wife!
line 4495-->    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
line 4496-->    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
line 4497-->    That chase thee from thy country, and expose
line 4498-->    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
line 4499-->    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
line 4500-->    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
line 4501-->    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
line 4502-->    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,  
line 4503-->    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
line 4504-->    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
line 4505-->    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
line 4506-->    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
line 4507-->    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
line 4508-->    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
line 4509-->    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
line 4510-->    His death was so effected. Better 'twere
line 4511-->    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
line 4512-->    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
line 4513-->    That all the miseries which nature owes
line 4514-->    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
line 4515-->    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
line 4516-->    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
line 4517-->    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
line 4518-->    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
line 4519-->    The air of paradise did fan the house,
line 4520-->    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
line 4521-->    That pitiful rumour may report my flight
line 4522-->    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.  
line 4523-->    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.         Exit
line 4524-->
line 4525-->
line 4526-->
line 4527-->
line 4528-->ACT III. SCENE 3.
line 4529-->Florence. Before the DUKE's palace
line 4530-->
line 4531-->Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, SOLDIERS,
line 4532-->drum and trumpets
line 4533-->
line 4534-->  DUKE. The General of our Horse thou art; and we,
line 4535-->    Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
line 4536-->    Upon thy promising fortune.
line 4537-->  BERTRAM. Sir, it is
line 4538-->    A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
line 4539-->    We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
line 4540-->    To th' extreme edge of hazard.
line 4541-->  DUKE. Then go thou forth;
line 4542-->    And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
line 4543-->    As thy auspicious mistress!
line 4544-->  BERTRAM. This very day,
line 4545-->    Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;
line 4546-->    Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
line 4547-->    A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
line 4548-->
line 4549-->
line 4550-->
line 4551-->
line 4552-->ACT III. SCENE 4.
line 4553-->Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
line 4554-->
line 4555-->Enter COUNTESS and STEWARD
line 4556-->
line 4557-->  COUNTESS. Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
line 4558-->    Might you not know she would do as she has done
line 4559-->    By sending me a letter? Read it again.
line 4560-->  STEWARD.  [Reads]  'I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.
line 4561-->    Ambitious love hath so in me offended
line 4562-->    That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
line 4563-->    With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
line 4564-->    Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
line 4565-->    My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.
line 4566-->    Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
line 4567-->    His name with zealous fervour sanctify.
line 4568-->    His taken labours bid him me forgive;
line 4569-->    I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
line 4570-->    From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
line 4571-->    Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.
line 4572-->    He is too good and fair for death and me;
line 4573-->    Whom I myself embrace to set him free.'  
line 4574-->  COUNTESS. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
line 4575-->    Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
line 4576-->    As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her,
line 4577-->    I could have well diverted her intents,
line 4578-->    Which thus she hath prevented.
line 4579-->  STEWARD. Pardon me, madam;
line 4580-->    If I had given you this at over-night,
line 4581-->    She might have been o'er ta'en; and yet she writes
line 4582-->    Pursuit would be but vain.
line 4583-->  COUNTESS. What angel shall
line 4584-->    Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
line 4585-->    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
line 4586-->    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
line 4587-->    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
line 4588-->    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
line 4589-->    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
line 4590-->    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
line 4591-->    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
line 4592-->    Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
line 4593-->    When haply he shall hear that she is gone  
line 4594-->    He will return; and hope I may that she,
line 4595-->    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
line 4596-->    Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
line 4597-->    Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
line 4598-->    To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
line 4599-->    My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
line 4600-->    Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.     Exeunt
line 4601-->
line 4602-->
line 4603-->
line 4604-->
line 4605-->ACT III. SCENE 5.
line 4606-->
line 4607-->Without the walls of Florence
line 4608-->A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
line 4609-->VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other CITIZENS
line 4610-->
line 4611-->  WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose
line 4612-->    all the sight.
line 4613-->  DIANA. They say the French count has done most honourable service.
line 4614-->  WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great'st commander;
line 4615-->    and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother.  [Tucket]
line 4616-->    We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you
line 4617-->    may know by their trumpets.
line 4618-->  MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the
line 4619-->    report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the
line 4620-->    honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as
line 4621-->    honesty.
line 4622-->  WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a
line 4623-->    gentleman his companion.
line 4624-->  MARIANA. I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy
line 4625-->    officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of  
line 4626-->    them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all
line 4627-->    these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a
line 4628-->    maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that
line 4629-->    so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that
line 4630-->    dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that
line 4631-->    threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I
line 4632-->    hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there
line 4633-->    were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.
line 4634-->  DIANA. You shall not need to fear me.
line 4635-->
line 4636-->            Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim
line 4637-->
line 4638-->  WIDOW. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie
line 4639-->    at my house: thither they send one another. I'll question her.
line 4640-->    God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?
line 4641-->  HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand.
line 4642-->    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
line 4643-->  WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.
line 4644-->  HELENA. Is this the way?
line 4645-->                                                  [A march afar]  
line 4646-->  WIDOW. Ay, marry, is't. Hark you! They come this way.
line 4647-->    If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
line 4648-->    But till the troops come by,
line 4649-->    I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;
line 4650-->    The rather for I think I know your hostess
line 4651-->    As ample as myself.
line 4652-->  HELENA. Is it yourself?
line 4653-->  WIDOW. If you shall please so, pilgrim.
line 4654-->  HELENA. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
line 4655-->  WIDOW. You came, I think, from France?
line 4656-->  HELENA. I did so.
line 4657-->  WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours
line 4658-->    That has done worthy service.
line 4659-->  HELENA. His name, I pray you.
line 4660-->  DIANA. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?
line 4661-->  HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;
line 4662-->    His face I know not.
line 4663-->  DIANA. What some'er he is,
line 4664-->    He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
line 4665-->    As 'tis reported, for the King had married him  
line 4666-->    Against his liking. Think you it is so?
line 4667-->  HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.
line 4668-->  DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the Count
line 4669-->    Reports but coarsely of her.
line 4670-->  HELENA. What's his name?
line 4671-->  DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.
line 4672-->  HELENA. O, I believe with him,
line 4673-->    In argument of praise, or to the worth
line 4674-->    Of the great Count himself, she is too mean
line 4675-->    To have her name repeated; all her deserving
line 4676-->    Is a reserved honesty, and that
line 4677-->    I have not heard examin'd.
line 4678-->  DIANA. Alas, poor lady!
line 4679-->    'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
line 4680-->    Of a detesting lord.
line 4681-->  WIDOW. I sweet, good creature, wheresoe'er she is
line 4682-->    Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her
line 4683-->    A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
line 4684-->  HELENA. How do you mean?
line 4685-->    May be the amorous Count solicits her  
line 4686-->    In the unlawful purpose.
line 4687-->  WIDOW. He does, indeed;
line 4688-->    And brokes with all that can in such a suit
line 4689-->    Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;
line 4690-->    But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard
line 4691-->    In honestest defence.
line 4692-->
line 4693-->    Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the
line 4694-->                          whole ARMY
line 4695-->
line 4696-->  MARIANA. The gods forbid else!
line 4697-->  WIDOW. So, now they come.
line 4698-->    That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;
line 4699-->    That, Escalus.
line 4700-->  HELENA. Which is the Frenchman?
line 4701-->  DIANA. He-
line 4702-->    That with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.
line 4703-->    I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester
line 4704-->    He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsome gentleman?
line 4705-->  HELENA. I like him well.  
line 4706-->  DIANA. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave
line 4707-->    That leads him to these places; were I his lady
line 4708-->    I would poison that vile rascal.
line 4709-->  HELENA. Which is he?
line 4710-->  DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?
line 4711-->  HELENA. Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.
line 4712-->  PAROLLES. Lose our drum! well.
line 4713-->  MARIANA. He's shrewdly vex'd at something.
line 4714-->    Look, he has spied us.
line 4715-->  WIDOW. Marry, hang you!
line 4716-->  MARIANA. And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
line 4717-->                              Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and ARMY
line 4718-->  WIDOW. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
line 4719-->    Where you shall host. Of enjoin'd penitents
line 4720-->    There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
line 4721-->    Already at my house.
line 4722-->  HELENA. I humbly thank you.
line 4723-->    Please it this matron and this gentle maid
line 4724-->    To eat with us to-night; the charge and thanking
line 4725-->    Shall be for me, and, to requite you further,  
line 4726-->    I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,
line 4727-->    Worthy the note.
line 4728-->    BOTH. We'll take your offer kindly.                   Exeunt
line 4729-->

line 4731-->
line 4732-->
line 4733-->ACT III. SCENE 6.
line 4734-->Camp before Florence
line 4735-->
line 4736-->Enter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS
line 4737-->
line 4738-->  SECOND LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.
line 4739-->  FIRST LORD. If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more
line 4740-->    in your respect.
line 4741-->  SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.
line 4742-->  BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
line 4743-->  SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
line 4744-->    without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a
line 4745-->    most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly
line 4746-->    promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your
line 4747-->    lordship's entertainment.
line 4748-->  FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his
line 4749-->    virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty
line 4750-->    business in a main danger fail you.
line 4751-->  BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
line 4752-->  FIRST LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which
line 4753-->    you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
line 4754-->  SECOND LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise  
line 4755-->    him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.
line 4756-->    We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
line 4757-->    but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
line 4758-->    we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at
line 4759-->    his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in
line 4760-->    the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and
line 4761-->    deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that
line 4762-->    with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my
line 4763-->    judgment in anything.
line 4764-->  FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he
line 4765-->    says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the bottom
line 4766-->    of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
line 4767-->    ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's
line 4768-->    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.
line 4769-->
line 4770-->                      Enter PAROLLES
line 4771-->
line 4772-->  SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of
line 4773-->    his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.
line 4774-->  BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your  
line 4775-->    disposition.
line 4776-->  FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.
line 4777-->  PAROLLES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was
line 4778-->    excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own
line 4779-->    wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
line 4780-->  FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the command of the
line 4781-->    service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
line 4782-->    have prevented, if he had been there to command.
line 4783-->  BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.
line 4784-->    Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to
line 4785-->    be recovered.
line 4786-->  PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.
line 4787-->  BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.
line 4788-->  PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is
line 4789-->    seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have
line 4790-->    that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'
line 4791-->  BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think
line 4792-->    your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
line 4793-->    again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise,
line 4794-->    and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you  
line 4795-->    speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to
line 4796-->    you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost
line 4797-->    syllable of our worthiness.
line 4798-->  PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
line 4799-->  BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.
line 4800-->  PAROLLES. I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen
line 4801-->    down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself
line 4802-->    into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further
line 4803-->    from me.
line 4804-->  BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?
line 4805-->  PAROLLES. I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the
line 4806-->    attempt I vow.
line 4807-->  BERTRAM. I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership,
line 4808-->    will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
line 4809-->  PAROLLES. I love not many words.                          Exit
line 4810-->  SECOND LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange
line 4811-->    fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this
line 4812-->    business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do,
line 4813-->    and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.
line 4814-->  FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is  
line 4815-->    that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week
line 4816-->    escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out,
line 4817-->    you have him ever after.
line 4818-->  BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
line 4819-->    so seriously he does address himself unto?
line 4820-->  SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and
line 4821-->    clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost
line 4822-->    emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is
line 4823-->    not for your lordship's respect.
line 4824-->  FIRST LORD. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.
line 4825-->    He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and
line 4826-->    he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you
line 4827-->    shall see this very night.
line 4828-->  SECOND LORD. I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught.
line 4829-->  BERTRAM. Your brother, he shall go along with me.
line 4830-->  SECOND LORD. As't please your lordship. I'll leave you.   Exit
line 4831-->  BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
line 4832-->    The lass I spoke of.
line 4833-->  FIRST LORD. But you say she's honest.
line 4834-->  BERTRAM. That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once,  
line 4835-->    And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
line 4836-->    By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,
line 4837-->    Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
line 4838-->    And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;
line 4839-->    Will you go see her?
line 4840-->  FIRST LORD. With all my heart, my lord.                 Exeunt
line 4841-->
line 4842-->
line 4843-->
line 4844-->
line 4845-->ACT III. SCENE 7.
line 4846-->Florence. The WIDOW'S house
line 4847-->
line 4848-->Enter HELENA and WIDOW
line 4849-->
line 4850-->  HELENA. If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
line 4851-->    I know not how I shall assure you further
line 4852-->    But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
line 4853-->  WIDOW. Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,
line 4854-->    Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
line 4855-->    And would not put my reputation now
line 4856-->    In any staining act.
line 4857-->  HELENA. Nor would I wish you.
line 4858-->  FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband,
line 4859-->    And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
line 4860-->    Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
line 4861-->    By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
line 4862-->    Err in bestowing it.
line 4863-->  WIDOW. I should believe you;
line 4864-->    For you have show'd me that which well approves
line 4865-->    Y'are great in fortune.
line 4866-->  HELENA. Take this purse of gold,  
line 4867-->    And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
line 4868-->    Which I will over-pay and pay again
line 4869-->    When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter
line 4870-->    Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
line 4871-->    Resolv'd to carry her. Let her in fine consent,
line 4872-->    As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
line 4873-->    Now his important blood will nought deny
line 4874-->    That she'll demand. A ring the County wears
line 4875-->    That downward hath succeeded in his house
line 4876-->    From son to son some four or five descents
line 4877-->    Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
line 4878-->    In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
line 4879-->    To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
line 4880-->    Howe'er repented after.
line 4881-->  WIDOW. Now I see
line 4882-->    The bottom of your purpose.
line 4883-->  HELENA. You see it lawful then. It is no more
line 4884-->    But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
line 4885-->    Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
line 4886-->    In fine, delivers me to fill the time,  
line 4887-->    Herself most chastely absent. After this,
line 4888-->    To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
line 4889-->    To what is pass'd already.
line 4890-->  WIDOW. I have yielded.
line 4891-->    Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
line 4892-->    That time and place with this deceit so lawful
line 4893-->    May prove coherent. Every night he comes
line 4894-->    With musics of all sorts, and songs compos'd
line 4895-->    To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us
line 4896-->    To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
line 4897-->    As if his life lay on 't.
line 4898-->  HELENA. Why then to-night
line 4899-->    Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
line 4900-->    Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
line 4901-->    And lawful meaning in a lawful act;
line 4902-->    Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
line 4903-->    But let's about it.                                   Exeunt

line 4919-->ACT IV. SCENE 1.
line 4920-->Without the Florentine camp
line 4921-->
line 4922-->Enter SECOND FRENCH LORD with five or six other SOLDIERS in ambush
line 4923-->
line 4924-->  SECOND LORD. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
line 4925-->    When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will;
line 4926-->    though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must
line 4927-->    not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we
line 4928-->    must produce for an interpreter.
line 4929-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.
line 4930-->  SECOND LORD. Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?
line 4931-->  FIRST SOLDIER. No, sir, I warrant you.
line 4932-->  SECOND LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?
line 4933-->  FIRST SOLDIER. E'en such as you speak to me.
line 4934-->  SECOND LORD. He must think us some band of strangers i' th'
line 4935-->    adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all
line 4936-->    neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of
line 4937-->    his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we
line 4938-->    seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
line 4939-->    gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must  
line 4940-->    seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two
line 4941-->    hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
line 4942-->
line 4943-->                         Enter PAROLLES
line 4944-->
line 4945-->  PAROLLES. Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time
line 4946-->    enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a
line 4947-->    very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me;
line 4948-->    and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door. I find my
line 4949-->    tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars
line 4950-->    before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my
line 4951-->    tongue.
line 4952-->  SECOND LORD. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was
line 4953-->    guilty of.
line 4954-->  PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery
line 4955-->    of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and
line 4956-->    knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and
line 4957-->    say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.
line 4958-->    They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I
line 4959-->    dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put  
line 4960-->    you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of
line 4961-->    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
line 4962-->  SECOND LORD. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that
line 4963-->    he is?
line 4964-->  PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn,
line 4965-->    or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
line 4966-->  SECOND LORD. We cannot afford you so.
line 4967-->  PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
line 4968-->    stratagem.
line 4969-->  SECOND LORD. 'Twould not do.
line 4970-->  PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd.
line 4971-->  SECOND LORD. Hardly serve.
line 4972-->  PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel-
line 4973-->  SECOND LORD. How deep?
line 4974-->  PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.
line 4975-->  SECOND LORD. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
line 4976-->  PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I
line 4977-->    recover'd it.
line 4978-->  SECOND LORD. You shall hear one anon.          [Alarum within]
line 4979-->  PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy's!  
line 4980-->  SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
line 4981-->  ALL. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.
line 4982-->  PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.
line 4983-->                                            [They blindfold him]
line 4984-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.
line 4985-->  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,
line 4986-->    And I shall lose my life for want of language.
line 4987-->    If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,
line 4988-->    Italian, or French, let him speak to me;
line 4989-->    I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
line 4990-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy
line 4991-->    tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for
line 4992-->    seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
line 4993-->  PAROLLES. O!
line 4994-->  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
line 4995-->  SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
line 4996-->  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet;
line 4997-->    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
line 4998-->    To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
line 4999-->    Something to save thy life.  
line 5000-->  PAROLLES. O, let me live,
line 5001-->    And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
line 5002-->    Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that
line 5003-->    Which you will wonder at.
line 5004-->  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?
line 5005-->  PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.
line 5006-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.
line 5007-->    Come on; thou art granted space.
line 5008-->                   Exit, PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within
line 5009-->  SECOND LORD. Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my brother
line 5010-->    We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
line 5011-->    Till we do hear from them.
line 5012-->  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.
line 5013-->  SECOND LORD. 'A will betray us all unto ourselves-
line 5014-->    Inform on that.
line 5015-->  SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.
line 5016-->  SECOND LORD. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
line 5017-->                                                          Exeunt

line 5022-->ACT IV. SCENE 2.
line 5023-->Florence. The WIDOW'S house
line 5024-->
line 5025-->Enter BERTRAM and DIANA
line 5026-->
line 5027-->  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.
line 5028-->  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.
line 5029-->  BERTRAM. Titled goddess;
line 5030-->    And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
line 5031-->    In your fine frame hath love no quality?
line 5032-->    If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,
line 5033-->    You are no maiden, but a monument;
line 5034-->    When you are dead, you should be such a one
line 5035-->    As you are now, for you are cold and stern;
line 5036-->    And now you should be as your mother was
line 5037-->    When your sweet self was got.
line 5038-->  DIANA. She then was honest.
line 5039-->  BERTRAM. So should you be.
line 5040-->  DIANA. No.
line 5041-->    My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
line 5042-->    As you owe to your wife.
line 5043-->  BERTRAM. No more o'that!  
line 5044-->    I prithee do not strive against my vows.
line 5045-->    I was compell'd to her; but I love the
line 5046-->    By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
line 5047-->    Do thee all rights of service.
line 5048-->  DIANA. Ay, so you serve us
line 5049-->    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses
line 5050-->    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
line 5051-->    And mock us with our bareness.
line 5052-->  BERTRAM. How have I sworn!
line 5053-->  DIANA. 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
line 5054-->    But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
line 5055-->    What is not holy, that we swear not by,
line 5056-->    But take the High'st to witness. Then, pray you, tell me:
line 5057-->    If I should swear by Jove's great attributes
line 5058-->    I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths
line 5059-->    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
line 5060-->    To swear by him whom I protest to love
line 5061-->    That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths
line 5062-->    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-
line 5063-->    At least in my opinion.  
line 5064-->  BERTRAM. Change it, change it;
line 5065-->    Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;
line 5066-->    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
line 5067-->    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
line 5068-->    But give thyself unto my sick desires,
line 5069-->    Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
line 5070-->    My love as it begins shall so persever.
line 5071-->  DIANA. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
line 5072-->    That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
line 5073-->  BERTRAM. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power
line 5074-->    To give it from me.
line 5075-->  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?
line 5076-->  BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house,
line 5077-->    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
line 5078-->    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
line 5079-->    In me to lose.
line 5080-->  DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring:
line 5081-->    My chastity's the jewel of our house,
line 5082-->    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
line 5083-->    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world  
line 5084-->    In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
line 5085-->    Brings in the champion Honour on my part
line 5086-->    Against your vain assault.
line 5087-->  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;
line 5088-->    My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
line 5089-->    And I'll be bid by thee.
line 5090-->  DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;
line 5091-->    I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
line 5092-->    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
line 5093-->    When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
line 5094-->    Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
line 5095-->    My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
line 5096-->    When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.
line 5097-->    And on your finger in the night I'll put
line 5098-->    Another ring, that what in time proceeds
line 5099-->    May token to the future our past deeds.
line 5100-->    Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won
line 5101-->    A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
line 5102-->  BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
line 5103--> Exit  
line 5104-->  DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
line 5105-->    You may so in the end.
line 5106-->    My mother told me just how he would woo,
line 5107-->    As if she sat in's heart; she says all men
line 5108-->    Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me
line 5109-->    When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
line 5110-->    When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
line 5111-->    Marry that will, I live and die a maid.
line 5112-->    Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin
line 5113-->    To cozen him that would unjustly win.                   Exit
line 5114-->
line 5115-->
line 5116-->
line 5117-->
line 5118-->ACT IV. SCENE 3.
line 5119-->The Florentine camp
line 5120-->
line 5121-->Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS
line 5122-->
line 5123-->  SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother's letter?
line 5124-->  FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is something
line 5125-->    in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd
line 5126-->    almost into another man.
line 5127-->  SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off
line 5128-->    so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
line 5129-->  FIRST LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
line 5130-->    of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to
line 5131-->    him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly
line 5132-->    with you.
line 5133-->  SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave
line 5134-->    of it.
line 5135-->  FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence,
line 5136-->    of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in
line 5137-->    the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring,
line 5138-->    and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
line 5139-->  SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves,  
line 5140-->    what things are we!
line 5141-->  FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of
line 5142-->    all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
line 5143-->    to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives
line 5144-->    against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows
line 5145-->    himself.
line 5146-->  SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
line 5147-->    unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?
line 5148-->  FIRST LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
line 5149-->  SECOND LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his
line 5150-->    company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own
line 5151-->    judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.
line 5152-->  FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
line 5153-->    presence must be the whip of the other.
line 5154-->  SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?
line 5155-->  FIRST LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.
line 5156-->  SECOND LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
line 5157-->  FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel
line 5158-->    higher, or return again into France?
line 5159-->  SECOND LORD. I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether  
line 5160-->    of his counsel.
line 5161-->  FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal
line 5162-->    of his act.
line 5163-->  SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his
line 5164-->    house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;
line 5165-->    which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
line 5166-->    accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature
line 5167-->    became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last
line 5168-->    breath, and now she sings in heaven.
line 5169-->  FIRST LORD. How is this justified?
line 5170-->  SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
line 5171-->    makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death
line 5172-->    itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was
line 5173-->    faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place.
line 5174-->  FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?
line 5175-->  SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
line 5176-->    point, to the full arming of the verity.
line 5177-->  FIRST LORD. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
line 5178-->  SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our
line 5179-->    losses!  
line 5180-->  FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
line 5181-->    tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for
line 5182-->    him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample.
line 5183-->  SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill
line 5184-->    together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them
line 5185-->    not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by
line 5186-->    our virtues.
line 5187-->
line 5188-->                      Enter a MESSENGER
line 5189-->
line 5190-->    How now? Where's your master?
line 5191-->  SERVANT. He met the Duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken
line 5192-->    a solemn leave. His lordship will next morning for France. The
line 5193-->    Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King.
line 5194-->  SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were
line 5195-->    more than they can commend.
line 5196-->  FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness.
line 5197-->    Here's his lordship now.
line 5198-->
line 5199-->                        Enter BERTRAM  
line 5200-->
line 5201-->    How now, my lord, is't not after midnight?
line 5202-->  BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a month's
line 5203-->    length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the
line 5204-->    Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd for
line 5205-->    her; writ to my lady mother I am returning; entertain'd my
line 5206-->    convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many
line 5207-->    nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended
line 5208-->    yet.
line 5209-->  SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning
line 5210-->    your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.
line 5211-->  BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it
line 5212-->    hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and
line 5213-->    the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has
line 5214-->    deceiv'd me like a double-meaning prophesier.
line 5215-->  SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat i' th'
line 5216-->    stocks all night, poor gallant knave.
line 5217-->  BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his
line 5218-->    spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
line 5219-->  SECOND LORD. I have told your lordship already the stocks carry  
line 5220-->    him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like
line 5221-->    a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to
line 5222-->    Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his
line 5223-->    remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th'
line 5224-->    stocks. And what think you he hath confess'd?
line 5225-->  BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a?
line 5226-->  SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
line 5227-->    face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must
line 5228-->    have the patience to hear it.
line 5229-->
line 5230-->                   Enter PAROLLES guarded, and
line 5231-->                  FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter
line 5232-->
line 5233-->  BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! He can say nothing of me.
line 5234-->  SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.
line 5235-->  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without
line 5236-->    'em?
line 5237-->  PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye
line 5238-->    pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
line 5239-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.  
line 5240-->  SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.
line 5241-->  FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you
line 5242-->    answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
line 5243-->  PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.
line 5244-->  FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is
line 5245-->    strong.' What say you to that?
line 5246-->  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable.
line 5247-->    The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor
line 5248-->    rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.
line 5249-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?
line 5250-->  PAROLLES. Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you
line 5251-->    will.
line 5252-->  BERTRAM. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
line 5253-->  SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles,
line 5254-->    the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole
line 5255-->    theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the
line 5256-->    chape of his dagger.
line 5257-->  FIRST LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
line 5258-->    clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
line 5259-->    apparel neatly.  
line 5260-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
line 5261-->  PAROLLES. 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true- 'or
line 5262-->    thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.
line 5263-->  SECOND LORD. He's very near the truth in this.
line 5264-->  BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it.
line 5265-->  PAROLLES. 'Poor rogues' I pray you say.
line 5266-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
line 5267-->  PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues are
line 5268-->    marvellous poor.
line 5269-->  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.'
line 5270-->    What say you to that?
line 5271-->  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I
line 5272-->    will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty;
line 5273-->    Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian,
line 5274-->    Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own
line 5275-->    company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each; so
line 5276-->    that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not
line 5277-->    to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the
line 5278-->    snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to
line 5279-->    pieces.  
line 5280-->  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?
line 5281-->  SECOND LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
line 5282-->    condition, and what credit I have with the Duke.
line 5283-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him
line 5284-->    whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his
line 5285-->    reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness
line 5286-->    in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
line 5287-->    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What say
line 5288-->    you to this? What do you know of it?
line 5289-->  PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the
line 5290-->    inter'gatories. Demand them singly.
line 5291-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?
line 5292-->  PAROLLES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from
line 5293-->    whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with child-a
line 5294-->    dumb innocent that could not say him nay.
line 5295-->  BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his
line 5296-->    brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
line 5297-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's
line 5298-->    camp?
line 5299-->  PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.  
line 5300-->  SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
line 5301-->    lordship anon.
line 5302-->  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?
line 5303-->  PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of
line 5304-->    mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band.
line 5305-->    I think I have his letter in my pocket.
line 5306-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll search.
line 5307-->  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it
line 5308-->    is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent.
line 5309-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to you?
line 5310-->  PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.
line 5311-->  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.
line 5312-->  SECOND LORD. Excellently.
line 5313-->  FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of
line 5314-->    gold.'
line 5315-->  PAROLLES. That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is an
line 5316-->    advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take
line 5317-->    heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle
line 5318-->    boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up
line 5319-->    again.  
line 5320-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.
line 5321-->  PAROLLES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf
line 5322-->    of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and
line 5323-->    lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all
line 5324-->    the fry it finds.
line 5325-->  BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!
line 5326-->  FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]
line 5327-->    'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
line 5328-->    After he scores, he never pays the score.
line 5329-->    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
line 5330-->    He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.
line 5331-->    And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
line 5332-->    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
line 5333-->    For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,
line 5334-->    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
line 5335-->    Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,
line 5336-->                                                   PAROLLES.'
line 5337-->  BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's
line 5338-->    forehead.
line 5339-->  FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold  
line 5340-->    linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.
line 5341-->  BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a
line 5342-->    cat to me.
line 5343-->  FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be
line 5344-->    fain to hang you.
line 5345-->  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die,
line 5346-->    but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the
line 5347-->    remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th'
line 5348-->    stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.
line 5349-->  FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
line 5350-->    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to
line 5351-->    his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his
line 5352-->    honesty?
line 5353-->  PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes
line 5354-->    and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of
line 5355-->    oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie,
line 5356-->    sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool.
line 5357-->    Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and
line 5358-->    in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about
line 5359-->    him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have  
line 5360-->    but little more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has everything
line 5361-->    that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should
line 5362-->    have he has nothing.
line 5363-->  SECOND LORD. I begin to love him for this.
line 5364-->  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For
line 5365-->    me, he's more and more a cat.
line 5366-->  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?
line 5367-->  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English
line 5368-->    tragedians-to belie him I will not-and more of his soldier-ship
line 5369-->    I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the
line 5370-->    officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the
line 5371-->    doubling of files-I would do the man what honour I can-but of
line 5372-->    this I am not certain.
line 5373-->  SECOND LORD. He hath out-villain'd villainy so far that the rarity
line 5374-->    redeems him.
line 5375-->  BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat still.
line 5376-->  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
line 5377-->    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
line 5378-->  PAROLLES. Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-simple of his
line 5379-->    salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all  
line 5380-->    remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.
line 5381-->  FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
line 5382-->  FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?
line 5383-->  FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?
line 5384-->  PAROLLES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great as
line 5385-->    the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He
line 5386-->    excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed one
line 5387-->    of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry,
line 5388-->    in coming on he has the cramp.
line 5389-->  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
line 5390-->    the Florentine?
line 5391-->  PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.
line 5392-->  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his
line 5393-->    pleasure.
line 5394-->  PAROLLES.  [Aside]  I'll no more drumming. A plague of all drums!
line 5395-->    Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of
line 5396-->    that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger.
line 5397-->    Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
line 5398-->  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die.
line 5399-->    The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the  
line 5400-->    secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men
line 5401-->    very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore
line 5402-->    you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head.
line 5403-->  PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
line 5404-->  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your
line 5405-->    friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any here?
line 5406-->  BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.
line 5407-->  FIRST LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.
line 5408-->  SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.
line 5409-->  FIRST LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am
line 5410-->    for France.
line 5411-->  SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
line 5412-->    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were not
line 5413-->    a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.
line 5414-->                                        Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS
line 5415-->  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that
line 5416-->    has a knot on 't yet.
line 5417-->  PAROLLES. Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?
line 5418-->  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were
line 5419-->    that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent  
line 5420-->    nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of
line 5421-->    you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS
line 5422-->  PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,
line 5423-->    'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
line 5424-->    But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft
line 5425-->    As captain shall. Simply the thing I am
line 5426-->    Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
line 5427-->    Let him fear this; for it will come to pass
line 5428-->    That every braggart shall be found an ass.
line 5429-->    Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles, live
line 5430-->    Safest in shame. Being fool'd, by fool'ry thrive.
line 5431-->    There's place and means for every man alive.
line 5432-->    I'll after them.                                        Exit
line 5433-->

line 5438-->The WIDOW'S house
line 5439-->
line 5440-->Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA
line 5441-->
line 5442-->  HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you!
line 5443-->    One of the greatest in the Christian world
line 5444-->    Shall be my surety; fore whose throne 'tis needful,
line 5445-->    Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
line 5446-->    Time was I did him a desired office,
line 5447-->    Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
line 5448-->    Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
line 5449-->    And answer 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd
line 5450-->    His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place
line 5451-->    We have convenient convoy. You must know
line 5452-->    I am supposed dead. The army breaking,
line 5453-->    My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
line 5454-->    And by the leave of my good lord the King,
line 5455-->    We'll be before our welcome.
line 5456-->  WIDOW. Gentle madam,
line 5457-->    You never had a servant to whose trust
line 5458-->    Your business was more welcome.  
line 5459-->  HELENA. Nor you, mistress,
line 5460-->    Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
line 5461-->    To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven
line 5462-->    Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
line 5463-->    As it hath fated her to be my motive
line 5464-->    And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
line 5465-->    That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
line 5466-->    When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
line 5467-->    Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play
line 5468-->    With what it loathes, for that which is away.
line 5469-->    But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
line 5470-->    Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
line 5471-->    Something in my behalf.
line 5472-->  DIANA. Let death and honesty
line 5473-->    Go with your impositions, I am yours
line 5474-->    Upon your will to suffer.
line 5475-->  HELENA. Yet, I pray you:
line 5476-->    But with the word the time will bring on summer,
line 5477-->    When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
line 5478-->    And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;  
line 5479-->    Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.
line 5480-->    All's Well that Ends Well. Still the fine's the crown.
line 5481-->    Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.           Exeunt

line 5486-->ACT IV SCENE 5.
line 5487-->Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
line 5488-->
line 5489-->Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and CLOWN
line 5490-->
line 5491-->  LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow
line 5492-->    there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak'd
line 5493-->    and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law
line 5494-->    had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more
line 5495-->    advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak
line 5496-->    of.
line 5497-->  COUNTESS. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most
line 5498-->    virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If
line 5499-->    she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a
line 5500-->    mother. I could not have owed her a more rooted love.
line 5501-->  LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand
line 5502-->    sallets ere we light on such another herb.
line 5503-->  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or,
line 5504-->    rather, the herb of grace.
line 5505-->  LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
line 5506-->  CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in
line 5507-->    grass.  
line 5508-->  LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?
line 5509-->  CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
line 5510-->  LAFEU. Your distinction?
line 5511-->  CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.
line 5512-->  LAFEU. So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
line 5513-->  CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
line 5514-->  LAFEU. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
line 5515-->  CLOWN. At your service.
line 5516-->  LAFEU. No, no, no.
line 5517-->  CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a
line 5518-->    prince as you are.
line 5519-->  LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman?
line 5520-->  CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more
line 5521-->    hotter in France than there.
line 5522-->  LAFEU. What prince is that?
line 5523-->  CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias,
line 5524-->    the devil.
line 5525-->  LAFEU. Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to suggest
line 5526-->    thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.
line 5527-->  CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire;  
line 5528-->    and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he
line 5529-->    is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I
line 5530-->    am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too
line 5531-->    little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but
line 5532-->    the many will be too chill and tender: and they'll be for the
line 5533-->    flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
line 5534-->  LAFEU. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee
line 5535-->    so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways;
line 5536-->    let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.
line 5537-->  CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'
line 5538-->    tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
line 5539--> Exit
line 5540-->  LAFEU. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.
line 5541-->  COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much  sport
line 5542-->    out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is
line 5543-->    a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs
line 5544-->    where he will.
line 5545-->  LAFEU. I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell
line 5546-->    you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord
line 5547-->    your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to  
line 5548-->    speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of
line 5549-->    them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did
line 5550-->    first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to
line 5551-->    stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there
line 5552-->    is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?
line 5553-->  COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily
line 5554-->    effected.
line 5555-->  LAFEU. His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as
line 5556-->    when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am
line 5557-->    deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.
line 5558-->  COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die.
line 5559-->    I have letters that my son will be here to-night. I shall beseech
line 5560-->    your lordship to remain with me tal they meet together.
line 5561-->  LAFEU. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be
line 5562-->    admitted.
line 5563-->  COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.
line 5564-->  LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my
line 5565-->    God, it holds yet.
line 5566-->
line 5567-->                         Re-enter CLOWN  
line 5568-->
line 5569-->  CLOWN. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet
line 5570-->    on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet
line 5571-->    knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a
line 5572-->    cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
line 5573-->  LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of
line 5574-->    honour; so belike is that.
line 5575-->  CLOWN. But it is your carbonado'd face.
line 5576-->  LAFEU. Let us go see your son, I pray you;
line 5577-->    I long to talk with the young noble soldier.
line 5578-->  CLOWN. Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats, and
line 5579-->    most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.
line 5580-->                                                          Exeunt

line 5596-->ACT V. SCENE 1.
line 5597-->Marseilles. A street
line 5598-->
line 5599-->Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA, with two ATTENDANTS
line 5600-->
line 5601-->  HELENA. But this exceeding posting day and night
line 5602-->    Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.
line 5603-->    But since you have made the days and nights as one,
line 5604-->    To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
line 5605-->    Be bold you do so grow in my requital
line 5606-->    As nothing can unroot you.
line 5607-->
line 5608-->                      Enter a GENTLEMAN
line 5609-->
line 5610-->    In happy time!
line 5611-->    This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,
line 5612-->    If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.
line 5613-->  GENTLEMAN. And you.
line 5614-->  HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
line 5615-->  GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.
line 5616-->  HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fall'n
line 5617-->    From the report that goes upon your goodness;  
line 5618-->    And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
line 5619-->    Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
line 5620-->    The use of your own virtues, for the which
line 5621-->    I shall continue thankful.
line 5622-->  GENTLEMAN. What's your will?
line 5623-->  HELENA. That it will please you
line 5624-->    To give this poor petition to the King;
line 5625-->    And aid me with that store of power you have
line 5626-->    To come into his presence.
line 5627-->  GENTLEMAN. The King's not here.
line 5628-->  HELENA. Not here, sir?
line 5629-->  GENTLEMAN. Not indeed.
line 5630-->    He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste
line 5631-->    Than is his use.
line 5632-->  WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains!
line 5633-->  HELENA. All's Well That Ends Well yet,
line 5634-->    Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
line 5635-->    I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
line 5636-->  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
line 5637-->    Whither I am going.  
line 5638-->  HELENA. I do beseech you, sir,
line 5639-->    Since you are like to see the King before me,
line 5640-->    Commend the paper to his gracious hand;
line 5641-->    Which I presume shall render you no blame,
line 5642-->    But rather make you thank your pains for it.
line 5643-->    I will come after you with what good speed
line 5644-->    Our means will make us means.
line 5645-->  GENTLEMAN. This I'll do for you.
line 5646-->  HELENA. And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
line 5647-->    Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again;
line 5648-->    Go, go, provide.                                      Exeunt

line 5653-->ACT V SCENE 2.
line 5654-->Rousillon. The inner court of the COUNT'S palace
line 5655-->
line 5656-->Enter CLOWN and PAROLLES
line 5657-->
line 5658-->  PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I
line 5659-->    have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held
line 5660-->    familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in
line 5661-->    Fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
line 5662-->    displeasure.
line 5663-->  CLOWN. Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell
line 5664-->    so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth eat no fish
line 5665-->    of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee, allow the wind.
line 5666-->  PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by
line 5667-->    a metaphor.
line 5668-->  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or
line 5669-->    against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.
line 5670-->  PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
line 5671-->  CLOWN. Foh! prithee stand away. A paper from Fortune's close-stool
line 5672-->    to give to a nobleman! Look here he comes himself.
line 5673-->
line 5674-->                           Enter LAFEU  
line 5675-->
line 5676-->    Here is a pur of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat, but not
line 5677-->    a musk-cat, that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond of her
line 5678-->    displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir,
line 5679-->    use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
line 5680-->    ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress
line 5681-->    in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship.
line 5682--> Exit
line 5683-->  PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch'd.
line 5684-->  LAFEU. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her
line 5685-->    nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that
line 5686-->    she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would
line 5687-->    not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for
line 5688-->    you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for
line 5689-->    other business.
line 5690-->  PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
line 5691-->  LAFEU. You beg a single penny more; come, you shall ha't; save your
line 5692-->    word.
line 5693-->  PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
line 5694-->  LAFEU. You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! give me your  
line 5695-->    hand. How does your drum?
line 5696-->  PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me.
line 5697-->  LAFEU. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.
line 5698-->  PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for
line 5699-->    you did bring me out.
line 5700-->  LAFEU. Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the
line 5701-->    office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the
line 5702-->    other brings thee out.    [Trumpets sound]  The King's coming; I
line 5703-->    know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had
line 5704-->    talk of you last night. Though you are a fool and a knave, you
line 5705-->    shall eat. Go to; follow.
line 5706-->  PAROLLES. I praise God for you.                         Exeunt
line 5707-->
line 5708-->
line 5709-->
line 5710-->
line 5711-->ACT V SCENE 3.
line 5712-->Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
line 5713-->
line 5714-->Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two FRENCH LORDS, with ATTENDANTS
line 5715-->
line 5716-->  KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem
line 5717-->    Was made much poorer by it; but your son,
line 5718-->    As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
line 5719-->    Her estimation home.
line 5720-->  COUNTESS. 'Tis past, my liege;
line 5721-->    And I beseech your Majesty to make it
line 5722-->    Natural rebellion, done i' th' blaze of youth,
line 5723-->    When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
line 5724-->    O'erbears it and burns on.
line 5725-->  KING. My honour'd lady,
line 5726-->    I have forgiven and forgotten all;
line 5727-->    Though my revenges were high bent upon him
line 5728-->    And watch'd the time to shoot.
line 5729-->  LAFEU. This I must say-
line 5730-->    But first, I beg my pardon: the young lord
line 5731-->    Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady,  
line 5732-->    Offence of mighty note; but to himself
line 5733-->    The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
line 5734-->    Whose beauty did astonish the survey
line 5735-->    Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;
line 5736-->    Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
line 5737-->    Humbly call'd mistress.
line 5738-->  KING. Praising what is lost
line 5739-->    Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
line 5740-->    We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill
line 5741-->    All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;
line 5742-->    The nature of his great offence is dead,
line 5743-->    And deeper than oblivion do we bury
line 5744-->    Th' incensing relics of it; let him approach,
line 5745-->    A stranger, no offender; and inform him
line 5746-->    So 'tis our will he should.
line 5747-->  GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN
line 5748-->  KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?
line 5749-->  LAFEU. All that he is hath reference to your Highness.
line 5750-->  KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
line 5751-->    That sets him high in fame.  
line 5752-->
line 5753-->                          Enter BERTRAM
line 5754-->
line 5755-->  LAFEU. He looks well on 't.
line 5756-->  KING. I am not a day of season,
line 5757-->    For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
line 5758-->    In me at once. But to the brightest beams
line 5759-->    Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
line 5760-->    The time is fair again.
line 5761-->  BERTRAM. My high-repented blames,
line 5762-->    Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
line 5763-->  KING. All is whole;
line 5764-->    Not one word more of the consumed time.
line 5765-->    Let's take the instant by the forward top;
line 5766-->    For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
line 5767-->    Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
line 5768-->    Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
line 5769-->    The daughter of this lord?
line 5770-->  BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first
line 5771-->    I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart  
line 5772-->    Durst make too bold herald of my tongue;
line 5773-->    Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
line 5774-->    Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
line 5775-->    Which warp'd the line of every other favour,
line 5776-->    Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n,
line 5777-->    Extended or contracted all proportions
line 5778-->    To a most hideous object. Thence it came
line 5779-->    That she whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,
line 5780-->    Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye
line 5781-->    The dust that did offend it.
line 5782-->  KING. Well excus'd.
line 5783-->    That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
line 5784-->    From the great compt; but love that comes too late,
line 5785-->    Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
line 5786-->    To the great sender turns a sour offence,
line 5787-->    Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
line 5788-->    Make trivial price of serious things we have,
line 5789-->    Not knowing them until we know their grave.
line 5790-->    Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
line 5791-->    Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;  
line 5792-->    Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
line 5793-->    While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
line 5794-->    Be this sweet Helen's knell. And now forget her.
line 5795-->    Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.
line 5796-->    The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
line 5797-->    To see our widower's second marriage-day.
line 5798-->  COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
line 5799-->    Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
line 5800-->  LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
line 5801-->    Must be digested; give a favour from you,
line 5802-->    To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
line 5803-->    That she may quickly come.
line 5804-->                                          [BERTRAM gives a ring]
line 5805-->    By my old beard,
line 5806-->    And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,
line 5807-->    Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,
line 5808-->    The last that e'er I took her leave at court,
line 5809-->    I saw upon her finger.
line 5810-->  BERTRAM. Hers it was not.
line 5811-->  KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,  
line 5812-->    While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
line 5813-->    This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen
line 5814-->    I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
line 5815-->    Necessitied to help, that by this token
line 5816-->    I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her
line 5817-->    Of what should stead her most?
line 5818-->  BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign,
line 5819-->    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
line 5820-->    The ring was never hers.
line 5821-->  COUNTESS. Son, on my life,
line 5822-->    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
line 5823-->    At her life's rate.
line 5824-->  LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.
line 5825-->  BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.
line 5826-->    In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
line 5827-->    Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
line 5828-->    Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
line 5829-->    I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd
line 5830-->    To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully
line 5831-->    I could not answer in that course of honour  
line 5832-->    As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,
line 5833-->    In heavy satisfaction, and would never
line 5834-->    Receive the ring again.
line 5835-->  KING. Plutus himself,
line 5836-->    That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,
line 5837-->    Hath not in nature's mystery more science
line 5838-->    Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
line 5839-->    Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
line 5840-->    That you are well acquainted with yourself,
line 5841-->    Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
line 5842-->    You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety
line 5843-->    That she would never put it from her finger
line 5844-->    Unless she gave it to yourself in bed-
line 5845-->    Where you have never come- or sent it us
line 5846-->    Upon her great disaster.
line 5847-->  BERTRAM. She never saw it.
line 5848-->  KING. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
line 5849-->    And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
line 5850-->    Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
line 5851-->    That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prove so.  
line 5852-->    And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,
line 5853-->    And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
line 5854-->    Her eyes myself, could win me to believe
line 5855-->    More than to see this ring. Take him away.
line 5856-->                                          [GUARDS seize BERTRAM]
line 5857-->    My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
line 5858-->    Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
line 5859-->    Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him.
line 5860-->    We'll sift this matter further.
line 5861-->  BERTRAM. If you shall prove
line 5862-->    This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
line 5863-->    Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
line 5864-->    Where she yet never was.                       Exit, guarded
line 5865-->  KING. I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.
line 5866-->
line 5867-->                        Enter a GENTLEMAN
line 5868-->
line 5869-->  GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign,
line 5870-->    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
line 5871-->    Here's a petition from a Florentine,  
line 5872-->    Who hath, for four or five removes, come short
line 5873-->    To tender it herself. I undertook it,
line 5874-->    Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
line 5875-->    Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,
line 5876-->    Is here attending; her business looks in her
line 5877-->    With an importing visage; and she told me
line 5878-->    In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
line 5879-->    Your Highness with herself.
line 5880-->  KING.  [Reads the letter]  'Upon his many protestations to marry me
line 5881-->    when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the
line 5882-->    Count Rousillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my
line 5883-->    honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave,
line 5884-->    and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King!
line 5885-->    in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor
line 5886-->    maid is undone.
line 5887-->                                                DIANA CAPILET.'
line 5888-->  LAFEU. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this.
line 5889-->    I'll none of him.
line 5890-->  KING. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafeu,
line 5891-->    To bring forth this discov'ry. Seek these suitors.  
line 5892-->    Go speedily, and bring again the Count.
line 5893-->                                               Exeunt ATTENDANTS
line 5894-->    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
line 5895-->    Was foully snatch'd.
line 5896-->  COUNTESS. Now, justice on the doers!
line 5897-->
line 5898-->                       Enter BERTRAM, guarded
line 5899-->
line 5900-->  KING. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you.
line 5901-->    And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
line 5902-->    Yet you desire to marry.
line 5903-->                                           Enter WIDOW and DIANA
line 5904-->    What woman's that?
line 5905-->  DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
line 5906-->    Derived from the ancient Capilet.
line 5907-->    My suit, as I do understand, you know,
line 5908-->    And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
line 5909-->  WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
line 5910-->    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
line 5911-->    And both shall cease, without your remedy.  
line 5912-->  KING. Come hither, Count; do you know these women?
line 5913-->  BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny
line 5914-->    But that I know them. Do they charge me further?
line 5915-->  DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
line 5916-->  BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.
line 5917-->  DIANA. If you shall marry,
line 5918-->    You give away this hand, and that is mine;
line 5919-->    You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
line 5920-->    You give away myself, which is known mine;
line 5921-->    For I by vow am so embodied yours
line 5922-->    That she which marries you must marry me,
line 5923-->    Either both or none.
line 5924-->  LAFEU.  [To BERTRAM]  Your reputation comes too short for
line 5925-->    my daughter; you are no husband for her.
line 5926-->  BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature
line 5927-->    Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highness
line 5928-->    Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
line 5929-->    Than for to think that I would sink it here.
line 5930-->  KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
line 5931-->    Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honour  
line 5932-->    Than in my thought it lies!
line 5933-->  DIANA. Good my lord,
line 5934-->    Ask him upon his oath if he does think
line 5935-->    He had not my virginity.
line 5936-->  KING. What say'st thou to her?
line 5937-->  BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,
line 5938-->    And was a common gamester to the camp.
line 5939-->  DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so
line 5940-->    He might have bought me at a common price.
line 5941-->    Do not believe him. o, behold this ring,
line 5942-->    Whose high respect and rich validity
line 5943-->    Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,
line 5944-->    He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,
line 5945-->    If I be one.
line 5946-->  COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.
line 5947-->    Of six preceding ancestors, that gem
line 5948-->    Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue,
line 5949-->    Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wife:
line 5950-->    That ring's a thousand proofs.
line 5951-->  KING. Methought you said  
line 5952-->    You saw one here in court could witness it.
line 5953-->  DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
line 5954-->    So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.
line 5955-->  LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
line 5956-->  KING. Find him, and bring him hither.        Exit an ATTENDANT
line 5957-->  BERTRAM. What of him?
line 5958-->    He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
line 5959-->    With all the spots o' th' world tax'd and debauch'd,
line 5960-->    Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
line 5961-->    Am I or that or this for what he'll utter
line 5962-->    That will speak anything?
line 5963-->  KING. She hath that ring of yours.
line 5964-->  BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,
line 5965-->    And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.
line 5966-->    She knew her distance, and did angle for me,
line 5967-->    Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
line 5968-->    As all impediments in fancy's course
line 5969-->    Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
line 5970-->    Her infinite cunning with her modern grace
line 5971-->    Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring;  
line 5972-->    And I had that which any inferior might
line 5973-->    At market-price have bought.
line 5974-->  DIANA. I must be patient.
line 5975-->    You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife
line 5976-->    May justly diet me. I pray you yet-
line 5977-->    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband-
line 5978-->    Send for your ring, I will return it home,
line 5979-->    And give me mine again.
line 5980-->  BERTRAM. I have it not.
line 5981-->  KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?
line 5982-->  DIANA. Sir, much like
line 5983-->    The same upon your finger.
line 5984-->  KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.
line 5985-->  DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.
line 5986-->  KING. The story, then, goes false you threw it him
line 5987-->    Out of a casement.
line 5988-->  DIANA. I have spoke the truth.
line 5989-->
line 5990-->                       Enter PAROLLES
line 5991-->  
line 5992-->  BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
line 5993-->  KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.
line 5994-->    Is this the man you speak of?
line 5995-->  DIANA. Ay, my lord.
line 5996-->  KING. Tell me, sirrah-but tell me true I charge you,
line 5997-->    Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
line 5998-->    Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off-
line 5999-->    By him and by this woman here what know you?
line 6000-->  PAROLLES. So please your Majesty, my master hath been an honourable
line 6001-->    gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.
line 6002-->  KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman?
line 6003-->  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
line 6004-->  KING. How, I pray you?
line 6005-->  PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
line 6006-->  KING. How is that?
line 6007-->  PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.
line 6008-->  KING. As thou art a knave and no knave.
line 6009-->    What an equivocal companion is this!
line 6010-->  PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's command.
line 6011-->  LAFEU. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.  
line 6012-->  DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me marriage?
line 6013-->  PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
line 6014-->  KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?
line 6015-->  PAROLLES. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I
line 6016-->    said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for
line 6017-->    her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know
line 6018-->    not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I
line 6019-->    knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising
line 6020-->    her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak
line 6021-->    of; therefore I will not speak what I know.
line 6022-->  KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are
line 6023-->    married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand
line 6024-->    aside.
line 6025-->    This ring, you say, was yours?
line 6026-->  DIANA. Ay, my good lord.
line 6027-->  KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?
line 6028-->  DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
line 6029-->  KING. Who lent it you?
line 6030-->  DIANA. It was not lent me neither.
line 6031-->  KING. Where did you find it then?  
line 6032-->  DIANA. I found it not.
line 6033-->  KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways,
line 6034-->    How could you give it him?
line 6035-->  DIANA. I never gave it him.
line 6036-->  LAFEU. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at
line 6037-->    pleasure.
line 6038-->  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.
line 6039-->  DIANA. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
line 6040-->  KING. Take her away, I do not like her now;
line 6041-->    To prison with her. And away with him.
line 6042-->    Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
line 6043-->    Thou diest within this hour.
line 6044-->  DIANA. I'll never tell you.
line 6045-->  KING. Take her away.
line 6046-->  DIANA. I'll put in bail, my liege.
line 6047-->  KING. I think thee now some common customer.
line 6048-->  DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
line 6049-->  KING. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?
line 6050-->  DIANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
line 6051-->    He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't:  
line 6052-->    I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
line 6053-->    Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;
line 6054-->    I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
line 6055-->                                             [Pointing to LAFEU]
line 6056-->  KING. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.
line 6057-->  DIANA. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;
line 6058-->                                                      Exit WIDOW
line 6059-->    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
line 6060-->    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
line 6061-->    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
line 6062-->    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
line 6063-->    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
line 6064-->    And at that time he got his wife with child.
line 6065-->    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
line 6066-->    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
line 6067-->    And now behold the meaning.
line 6068-->
line 6069-->                     Re-enter WIDOW with HELENA
line 6070-->
line 6071-->  KING. Is there no exorcist  
line 6072-->    Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
line 6073-->    Is't real that I see?
line 6074-->  HELENA. No, my good lord;
line 6075-->    'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
line 6076-->    The name and not the thing.
line 6077-->  BERTRAM. Both, both; o, pardon!
line 6078-->  HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,
line 6079-->    I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,
line 6080-->    And, look you, here's your letter. This it says:
line 6081-->    'When from my finger you can get this ring,
line 6082-->    And are by me with child,' etc. This is done.
line 6083-->    Will you be mine now you are doubly won?
line 6084-->  BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
line 6085-->    I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
line 6086-->  HELENA. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue,
line 6087-->    Deadly divorce step between me and you!
line 6088-->    O my dear mother, do I see you living?
line 6089-->  LAFEU. Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. [To PAROLLES]
line 6090-->    Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I
line 6091-->    thank thee. Wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee;  
line 6092-->    let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones.
line 6093-->  KING. Let us from point to point this story know,
line 6094-->    To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
line 6095-->    [To DIANA]  If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,
line 6096-->    Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
line 6097-->    For I can guess that by thy honest aid
line 6098-->    Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.-
line 6099-->    Of that and all the progress, more and less,
line 6100-->    Resolvedly more leisure shall express.
line 6101-->    All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
line 6102-->    The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.       [Flourish]
line 6103-->
line 6104-->EPILOGUE
line 6105-->                             EPILOGUE.
line 6106-->
line 6107-->  KING. The King's a beggar, now the play is done.
line 6108-->    All is well ended if this suit be won,
line 6109-->    That you express content; which we will pay
line 6110-->    With strife to please you, day exceeding day.
line 6111-->    Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
line 6112-->    Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
line 6113-->                                                    Exeunt omnes

line 6196-->
line 6197-->SCENE:
line 6198-->The Roman Empire
line 6199-->
line 6200-->ACT I. SCENE I.
line 6201-->Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
line 6202-->
line 6203-->Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO
line 6204-->
line 6205-->  PHILO. Nay, but this dotage of our general's
line 6206-->    O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
line 6207-->    That o'er the files and musters of the war
line 6208-->    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
line 6209-->    The office and devotion of their view
line 6210-->    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
line 6211-->    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
line 6212-->    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
line 6213-->    And is become the bellows and the fan
line 6214-->    To cool a gipsy's lust.
line 6215-->
line 6216-->     Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train,
line 6217-->                    with eunuchs fanning her
line 6218-->
line 6219-->    Look where they come!
line 6220-->    Take but good note, and you shall see in him
line 6221-->    The triple pillar of the world transform'd  
line 6222-->    Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.
line 6223-->  CLEOPATRA. If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
line 6224-->  ANTONY. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
line 6225-->  CLEOPATRA. I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
line 6226-->  ANTONY. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
line 6227-->
line 6228-->                       Enter a MESSENGER
line 6229-->
line 6230-->  MESSENGER. News, my good lord, from Rome.
line 6231-->  ANTONY. Grates me the sum.
line 6232-->  CLEOPATRA. Nay, hear them, Antony.
line 6233-->    Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows
line 6234-->    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
line 6235-->    His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;
line 6236-->    Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;
line 6237-->    Perform't, or else we damn thee.'
line 6238-->  ANTONY. How, my love?
line 6239-->  CLEOPATRA. Perchance? Nay, and most like,
line 6240-->    You must not stay here longer; your dismission
line 6241-->    Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.  
line 6242-->    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?
line 6243-->    Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen,
line 6244-->    Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
line 6245-->    Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame
line 6246-->    When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
line 6247-->  ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
line 6248-->    Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
line 6249-->    Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
line 6250-->    Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life
line 6251-->    Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair
line 6252-->    And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
line 6253-->    On pain of punishment, the world to weet
line 6254-->    We stand up peerless.
line 6255-->  CLEOPATRA. Excellent falsehood!
line 6256-->    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
line 6257-->    I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony
line 6258-->    Will be himself.
line 6259-->  ANTONY. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
line 6260-->    Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,
line 6261-->    Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;  
line 6262-->    There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
line 6263-->    Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?
line 6264-->  CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors.
line 6265-->  ANTONY. Fie, wrangling queen!
line 6266-->    Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,
line 6267-->    To weep; whose every passion fully strives
line 6268-->    To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.
line 6269-->    No messenger but thine, and all alone
line 6270-->    To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
line 6271-->    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
line 6272-->    Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.
line 6273-->                     Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train
line 6274-->  DEMETRIUS. Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
line 6275-->  PHILO. Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,
line 6276-->    He comes too short of that great property
line 6277-->    Which still should go with Antony.
line 6278-->  DEMETRIUS. I am full sorry
line 6279-->    That he approves the common liar, who
line 6280-->    Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
line 6281-->    Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!            Exeunt
line 6282-->
line 6283-->
line 6284-->
line 6285-->
line 6286-->SCENE II.
line 6287-->Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
line 6288-->
line 6289-->Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SOOTHSAYER
line 6290-->
line 6291-->  CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
line 6292-->    most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so
line 6293-->    to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must
line 6294-->    charge his horns with garlands!
line 6295-->  ALEXAS. Soothsayer!
line 6296-->  SOOTHSAYER. Your will?
line 6297-->  CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
line 6298-->  SOOTHSAYER. In nature's infinite book of secrecy
line 6299-->    A little I can read.
line 6300-->  ALEXAS. Show him your hand.
line 6301-->
line 6302-->                       Enter ENOBARBUS
line 6303-->
line 6304-->  ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
line 6305-->    Cleopatra's health to drink.
line 6306-->  CHARMIAN. Good, sir, give me good fortune.
line 6307-->  SOOTHSAYER. I make not, but foresee.  
line 6308-->  CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.
line 6309-->  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
line 6310-->  CHARMIAN. He means in flesh.
line 6311-->  IRAS. No, you shall paint when you are old.
line 6312-->  CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid!
line 6313-->  ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
line 6314-->  CHARMIAN. Hush!
line 6315-->  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be more beloving than beloved.
line 6316-->  CHARMIAN. I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
line 6317-->  ALEXAS. Nay, hear him.
line 6318-->  CHARMIAN. Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
line 6319-->    three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a
line 6320-->    child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
line 6321-->    marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
line 6322-->  SOOTHSAYER. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
line 6323-->  CHARMIAN. O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
line 6324-->  SOOTHSAYER. You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
line 6325-->    Than that which is to approach.
line 6326-->  CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shall have no names.
line 6327-->    Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?  
line 6328-->  SOOTHSAYER. If every of your wishes had a womb,
line 6329-->    And fertile every wish, a million.
line 6330-->  CHARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
line 6331-->  ALEXAS. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
line 6332-->  CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
line 6333-->  ALEXAS. We'll know all our fortunes.
line 6334-->  ENOBARBUS. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be-
line 6335-->    drunk to bed.
line 6336-->  IRAS. There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
line 6337-->  CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
line 6338-->  IRAS. Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
line 6339-->  CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
line 6340-->    cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.
line 6341-->  SOOTHSAYER. Your fortunes are alike.
line 6342-->  IRAS. But how, but how? Give me particulars.
line 6343-->  SOOTHSAYER. I have said.
line 6344-->  IRAS. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
line 6345-->  CHARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
line 6346-->    where would you choose it?
line 6347-->  IRAS. Not in my husband's nose.  
line 6348-->  CHARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
line 6349-->    fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,
line 6350-->    sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
line 6351-->    worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow
line 6352-->    him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
line 6353-->    me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good
line 6354-->    Isis, I beseech thee!
line 6355-->  IRAS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as
line 6356-->    it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is
line 6357-->    a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,
line 6358-->    dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
line 6359-->  CHARMIAN. Amen.
line 6360-->  ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
line 6361-->    would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!
line 6362-->
line 6363-->                          Enter CLEOPATRA
line 6364-->
line 6365-->  ENOBARBUS. Hush! Here comes Antony.
line 6366-->  CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen.
line 6367-->  CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord?  
line 6368-->  ENOBARBUS. No, lady.
line 6369-->  CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?
line 6370-->  CHARMIAN. No, madam.
line 6371-->  CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
line 6372-->    A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
line 6373-->  ENOBARBUS. Madam?
line 6374-->  CLEOPATRA. Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
line 6375-->  ALEXAS. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
line 6376-->
line 6377-->          Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and attendants
line 6378-->
line 6379-->  CLEOPATRA. We will not look upon him. Go with us.
line 6380-->                       Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest
line 6381-->  MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
line 6382-->  ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius?
line 6383-->  MESSENGER. Ay.
line 6384-->    But soon that war had end, and the time's state
line 6385-->    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
line 6386-->    Whose better issue in the war from Italy
line 6387-->    Upon the first encounter drave them.  
line 6388-->  ANTONY. Well, what worst?
line 6389-->  MESSENGER. The nature of bad news infects the teller.
line 6390-->  ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
line 6391-->    Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
line 6392-->    Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
line 6393-->    I hear him as he flatter'd.
line 6394-->  MESSENGER. Labienus-
line 6395-->    This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
line 6396-->    Extended Asia from Euphrates,
line 6397-->    His conquering banner shook from Syria
line 6398-->    To Lydia and to Ionia,
line 6399-->    Whilst-
line 6400-->  ANTONY. Antony, thou wouldst say.
line 6401-->  MESSENGER. O, my lord!
line 6402-->  ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
line 6403-->    Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.
line 6404-->    Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults
line 6405-->    With such full licence as both truth and malice
line 6406-->    Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds
line 6407-->    When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us  
line 6408-->    Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
line 6409-->  MESSENGER. At your noble pleasure.                        Exit
line 6410-->  ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
line 6411-->  FIRST ATTENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?
line 6412-->  SECOND ATTENDANT. He stays upon your will.
line 6413-->  ANTONY. Let him appear.
line 6414-->    These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
line 6415-->    Or lose myself in dotage.
line 6416-->
line 6417-->                 Enter another MESSENGER with a letter
line 6418-->
line 6419-->    What are you?
line 6420-->  SECOND MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife is dead.
line 6421-->  ANTONY. Where died she?
line 6422-->  SECOND MESSENGER. In Sicyon.
line 6423-->    Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
line 6424-->    Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]
line 6425-->  ANTONY. Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER
line 6426-->    There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
line 6427-->    What our contempts doth often hurl from us  
line 6428-->    We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
line 6429-->    By revolution low'ring, does become
line 6430-->    The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;
line 6431-->    The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
line 6432-->    I must from this enchanting queen break off.
line 6433-->    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
line 6434-->    My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!
line 6435-->
line 6436-->                    Re-enter ENOBARBUS
line 6437-->
line 6438-->  ENOBARBUS. What's your pleasure, sir?
line 6439-->  ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.
line 6440-->  ENOBARBUS. Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an
line 6441-->    unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the
line 6442-->    word.
line 6443-->  ANTONY. I must be gone.
line 6444-->  ENOBARBUS. Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
line 6445-->    to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great
line 6446-->    cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but
line 6447-->    the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die  
line 6448-->    twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle
line 6449-->    in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a
line 6450-->    celerity in dying.
line 6451-->  ANTONY. She is cunning past man's thought.
line 6452-->  ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the
line 6453-->    finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters
line 6454-->    sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than
line 6455-->    almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
line 6456-->    makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.
line 6457-->  ANTONY. Would I had never seen her!
line 6458-->  ENOBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
line 6459-->    work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
line 6460-->    your travel.
line 6461-->  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
line 6462-->  ENOBARBUS. Sir?
line 6463-->  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
line 6464-->  ENOBARBUS. Fulvia?
line 6465-->  ANTONY. Dead.
line 6466-->  ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
line 6467-->    pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it  
line 6468-->    shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that
line 6469-->    when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If
line 6470-->    there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
line 6471-->    and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with
line 6472-->    consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and
line 6473-->    indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
line 6474-->  ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state
line 6475-->    Cannot endure my absence.
line 6476-->  ENOBARBUS. And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
line 6477-->    without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends
line 6478-->    on your abode.
line 6479-->  ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our officers
line 6480-->    Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
line 6481-->    The cause of our expedience to the Queen,
line 6482-->    And get her leave to part. For not alone
line 6483-->    The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
line 6484-->    Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to
line 6485-->    Of many our contriving friends in Rome
line 6486-->    Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
line 6487-->    Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands  
line 6488-->    The empire of the sea; our slippery people,
line 6489-->    Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
line 6490-->    Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
line 6491-->    Pompey the Great and all his dignities
line 6492-->    Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
line 6493-->    Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
line 6494-->    For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
line 6495-->    The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding
line 6496-->    Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
line 6497-->    And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
line 6498-->    To such whose place is under us, requires
line 6499-->    Our quick remove from hence.
line 6500-->  ENOBARBUS. I shall do't.                                Exeunt
line 6501-->
line 6502-->
line 6503-->
line 6504-->
line 6505-->SCENE III.
line 6506-->Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
line 6507-->
line 6508-->Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
line 6509-->
line 6510-->  CLEOPATRA. Where is he?
line 6511-->  CHARMIAN. I did not see him since.
line 6512-->  CLEOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
line 6513-->    I did not send you. If you find him sad,
line 6514-->    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
line 6515-->    That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.        Exit ALEXAS
line 6516-->  CHARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
line 6517-->    You do not hold the method to enforce
line 6518-->    The like from him.
line 6519-->  CLEOPATRA. What should I do I do not?
line 6520-->  CHARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
line 6521-->  CLEOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
line 6522-->  CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
line 6523-->    In time we hate that which we often fear.
line 6524-->
line 6525-->                            Enter ANTONY
line 6526-->  
line 6527-->    But here comes Antony.
line 6528-->  CLEOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.
line 6529-->  ANTONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
line 6530-->  CLEOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.
line 6531-->    It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature
line 6532-->    Will not sustain it.
line 6533-->  ANTONY. Now, my dearest queen-
line 6534-->  CLEOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me.
line 6535-->  ANTONY. What's the matter?
line 6536-->  CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.
line 6537-->    What says the married woman? You may go.
line 6538-->    Would she had never given you leave to come!
line 6539-->    Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-
line 6540-->    I have no power upon you; hers you are.
line 6541-->  ANTONY. The gods best know-
line 6542-->  CLEOPATRA. O, never was there queen
line 6543-->    So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first
line 6544-->    I saw the treasons planted.
line 6545-->  ANTONY. Cleopatra-
line 6546-->  CLEOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,  
line 6547-->    Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
line 6548-->    Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
line 6549-->    To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
line 6550-->    Which break themselves in swearing!
line 6551-->  ANTONY. Most sweet queen-
line 6552-->  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
line 6553-->    But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,
line 6554-->    Then was the time for words. No going then!
line 6555-->    Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
line 6556-->    Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor
line 6557-->    But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
line 6558-->    Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
line 6559-->    Art turn'd the greatest liar.
line 6560-->  ANTONY. How now, lady!
line 6561-->  CLEOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
line 6562-->    There were a heart in Egypt.
line 6563-->  ANTONY. Hear me, queen:
line 6564-->    The strong necessity of time commands
line 6565-->    Our services awhile; but my full heart
line 6566-->    Remains in use with you. Our Italy  
line 6567-->    Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
line 6568-->    Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
line 6569-->    Equality of two domestic powers
line 6570-->    Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,
line 6571-->    Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,
line 6572-->    Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
line 6573-->    Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
line 6574-->    Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
line 6575-->    And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
line 6576-->    By any desperate change. My more particular,
line 6577-->    And that which most with you should safe my going,
line 6578-->    Is Fulvia's death.
line 6579-->  CLEOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
line 6580-->     It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?
line 6581-->  ANTONY. She's dead, my Queen.
line 6582-->    Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
line 6583-->    The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.
line 6584-->    See when and where she died.
line 6585-->  CLEOPATRA. O most false love!
line 6586-->    Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill  
line 6587-->    With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
line 6588-->    In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be.
line 6589-->  ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
line 6590-->    The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
line 6591-->    As you shall give th' advice. By the fire
line 6592-->    That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
line 6593-->    Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
line 6594-->    As thou affects.
line 6595-->  CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
line 6596-->    But let it be; I am quickly ill and well-
line 6597-->    So Antony loves.
line 6598-->  ANTONY. My precious queen, forbear,
line 6599-->    And give true evidence to his love, which stands
line 6600-->    An honourable trial.
line 6601-->  CLEOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.
line 6602-->    I prithee turn aside and weep for her;
line 6603-->    Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
line 6604-->    Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
line 6605-->    Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
line 6606-->    Like perfect honour.  
line 6607-->  ANTONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.
line 6608-->  CLEOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
line 6609-->  ANTONY. Now, by my sword-
line 6610-->  CLEOPATRA. And target. Still he mends;
line 6611-->    But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
line 6612-->    How this Herculean Roman does become
line 6613-->    The carriage of his chafe.
line 6614-->  ANTONY. I'll leave you, lady.
line 6615-->  CLEOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.
line 6616-->    Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.
line 6617-->    Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it.
line 6618-->    That you know well. Something it is I would-
line 6619-->    O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
line 6620-->    And I am all forgotten!
line 6621-->  ANTONY. But that your royalty
line 6622-->    Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
line 6623-->    For idleness itself.
line 6624-->  CLEOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour
line 6625-->    To bear such idleness so near the heart
line 6626-->    As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;  
line 6627-->    Since my becomings kill me when they do not
line 6628-->    Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;
line 6629-->    Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
line 6630-->    And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
line 6631-->    Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
line 6632-->    Be strew'd before your feet!
line 6633-->  ANTONY. Let us go. Come.
line 6634-->    Our separation so abides and flies
line 6635-->    That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,
line 6636-->    And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
line 6637-->    Away!                                                 Exeunt
line 6638-->
line 6639-->
line 6640-->
line 6641-->
line 6642-->SCENE IV.
line 6643-->Rome. CAESAR'S house
line 6644-->
line 6645-->Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter; LEPIDUS, and their train
line 6646-->
line 6647-->  CAESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
line 6648-->    It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
line 6649-->    Our great competitor. From Alexandria
line 6650-->    This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
line 6651-->    The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
line 6652-->    Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
line 6653-->    More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
line 6654-->    Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shall find there
line 6655-->    A man who is the abstract of all faults
line 6656-->    That all men follow.
line 6657-->  LEPIDUS. I must not think there are
line 6658-->    Evils enow to darken all his goodness.
line 6659-->    His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,
line 6660-->    More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
line 6661-->    Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
line 6662-->    Than what he chooses.  
line 6663-->  CAESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
line 6664-->    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
line 6665-->    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
line 6666-->    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
line 6667-->    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
line 6668-->    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
line 6669-->    As his composure must be rare indeed
line 6670-->    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
line 6671-->    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
line 6672-->    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
line 6673-->    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
line 6674-->    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
line 6675-->    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
line 6676-->    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
line 6677-->    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
line 6678-->    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
line 6679-->    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
line 6680-->    And so rebel to judgment.
line 6681-->
line 6682-->                   Enter a MESSENGER  
line 6683-->
line 6684-->  LEPIDUS. Here's more news.
line 6685-->  MESSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
line 6686-->    Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
line 6687-->    How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
line 6688-->    And it appears he is belov'd of those
line 6689-->    That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
line 6690-->    The discontents repair, and men's reports
line 6691-->    Give him much wrong'd.
line 6692-->  CAESAR. I should have known no less.
line 6693-->    It hath been taught us from the primal state
line 6694-->    That he which is was wish'd until he were;
line 6695-->    And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
line 6696-->    Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
line 6697-->    Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
line 6698-->    Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
line 6699-->    To rot itself with motion.
line 6700-->  MESSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word
line 6701-->    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
line 6702-->    Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound  
line 6703-->    With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
line 6704-->    They make in Italy; the borders maritime
line 6705-->    Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.
line 6706-->    No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
line 6707-->    Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
line 6708-->    Than could his war resisted.
line 6709-->  CAESAR. Antony,
line 6710-->    Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
line 6711-->    Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
line 6712-->    Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
line 6713-->    Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
line 6714-->    Though daintily brought up, with patience more
line 6715-->    Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
line 6716-->    The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
line 6717-->    Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign
line 6718-->    The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
line 6719-->    Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
line 6720-->    The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps
line 6721-->    It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
line 6722-->    Which some did die to look on. And all this-  
line 6723-->    It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-
line 6724-->    Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
line 6725-->    So much as lank'd not.
line 6726-->  LEPIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.
line 6727-->  CAESAR. Let his shames quickly
line 6728-->    Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
line 6729-->    Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end
line 6730-->    Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
line 6731-->    Thrives in our idleness.
line 6732-->  LEPIDUS. To-morrow, Caesar,
line 6733-->    I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
line 6734-->    Both what by sea and land I can be able
line 6735-->    To front this present time.
line 6736-->  CAESAR. Till which encounter
line 6737-->    It is my business too. Farewell.
line 6738-->  LEPIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
line 6739-->    Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
line 6740-->    To let me be partaker.
line 6741-->  CAESAR. Doubt not, sir;
line 6742-->    I knew it for my bond.                                Exeunt
line 6743-->
line 6744-->
line 6745-->
line 6746-->
line 6747-->SCENE V.
line 6748-->Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
line 6749-->
line 6750-->Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
line 6751-->
line 6752-->  CLEOPATRA. Charmian!
line 6753-->  CHARMIAN. Madam?
line 6754-->  CLEOPATRA. Ha, ha!
line 6755-->    Give me to drink mandragora.
line 6756-->  CHARMIAN. Why, madam?
line 6757-->  CLEOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
line 6758-->    My Antony is away.
line 6759-->  CHARMIAN. You think of him too much.
line 6760-->  CLEOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
line 6761-->  CHARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
line 6762-->  CLEOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
line 6763-->  MARDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
line 6764-->  CLEOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
line 6765-->    In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
line 6766-->    That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
line 6767-->    May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
line 6768-->  MARDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.  
line 6769-->  CLEOPATRA. Indeed?
line 6770-->  MARDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
line 6771-->    But what indeed is honest to be done.
line 6772-->    Yet have I fierce affections, and think
line 6773-->    What Venus did with Mars.
line 6774-->  CLEOPATRA. O Charmian,
line 6775-->    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
line 6776-->    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
line 6777-->    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
line 6778-->    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
line 6779-->    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
line 6780-->    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
line 6781-->    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
line 6782-->    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
line 6783-->    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
line 6784-->    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
line 6785-->    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
line 6786-->    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
line 6787-->    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
line 6788-->    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;  
line 6789-->    There would he anchor his aspect and die
line 6790-->    With looking on his life.
line 6791-->
line 6792-->                         Enter ALEXAS
line 6793-->
line 6794-->  ALEXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
line 6795-->  CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
line 6796-->    Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath
line 6797-->    With his tinct gilded thee.
line 6798-->    How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
line 6799-->  ALEXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
line 6800-->    He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
line 6801-->    This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
line 6802-->  CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
line 6803-->  ALEXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
line 6804-->    'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
line 6805-->    This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
line 6806-->    To mend the petty present, I will piece
line 6807-->    Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
line 6808-->    Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,  
line 6809-->    And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
line 6810-->    Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
line 6811-->    Was beastly dumb'd by him.
line 6812-->  CLEOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
line 6813-->  ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
line 6814-->    Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
line 6815-->  CLEOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
line 6816-->    Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!
line 6817-->    He was not sad, for he would shine on those
line 6818-->    That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
line 6819-->    Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
line 6820-->    In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
line 6821-->    O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
line 6822-->    The violence of either thee becomes,
line 6823-->    So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
line 6824-->  ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
line 6825-->    Why do you send so thick?
line 6826-->  CLEOPATRA. Who's born that day
line 6827-->    When I forget to send to Antony
line 6828-->    Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.  
line 6829-->    Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
line 6830-->    Ever love Caesar so?
line 6831-->  CHARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
line 6832-->  CLEOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
line 6833-->    Say 'the brave Antony.'
line 6834-->  CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
line 6835-->  CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
line 6836-->    If thou with Caesar paragon again
line 6837-->    My man of men.
line 6838-->  CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
line 6839-->    I sing but after you.
line 6840-->  CLEOPATRA. My salad days,
line 6841-->    When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
line 6842-->    To say as I said then. But come, away!
line 6843-->    Get me ink and paper.
line 6844-->    He shall have every day a several greeting,
line 6845-->    Or I'll unpeople Egypt.                               Exeunt

line 6861-->ACT II. SCENE I.
line 6862-->Messina. POMPEY'S house
line 6863-->
line 6864-->Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner
line 6865-->
line 6866-->  POMPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist
line 6867-->    The deeds of justest men.
line 6868-->  MENECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,
line 6869-->    That what they do delay they not deny.
line 6870-->  POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
line 6871-->    The thing we sue for.
line 6872-->  MENECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,
line 6873-->    Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs
line 6874-->    Deny us for our good; so find we profit
line 6875-->    By losing of our prayers.
line 6876-->  POMPEY. I shall do well.
line 6877-->    The people love me, and the sea is mine;
line 6878-->    My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
line 6879-->    Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony
line 6880-->    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
line 6881-->    No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where  
line 6882-->    He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
line 6883-->    Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
line 6884-->    Nor either cares for him.
line 6885-->  MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus
line 6886-->    Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.
line 6887-->  POMPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.
line 6888-->  MENAS. From Silvius, sir.
line 6889-->  POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
line 6890-->    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
line 6891-->    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
line 6892-->    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
line 6893-->    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
line 6894-->    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
line 6895-->    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
line 6896-->    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
line 6897-->    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-
line 6898-->
line 6899-->                       Enter VARRIUS
line 6900-->
line 6901-->    How now, Varrius!  
line 6902-->  VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:
line 6903-->    Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
line 6904-->    Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis
line 6905-->    A space for farther travel.
line 6906-->  POMPEY. I could have given less matter
line 6907-->    A better ear. Menas, I did not think
line 6908-->    This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
line 6909-->    For such a petty war; his soldiership
line 6910-->    Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
line 6911-->    The higher our opinion, that our stirring
line 6912-->    Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
line 6913-->    The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
line 6914-->  MENAS. I cannot hope
line 6915-->    Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
line 6916-->    His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
line 6917-->    His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
line 6918-->    Not mov'd by Antony.
line 6919-->  POMPEY. I know not, Menas,
line 6920-->    How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
line 6921-->    Were't not that we stand up against them all,  
line 6922-->    'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
line 6923-->    For they have entertained cause enough
line 6924-->    To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
line 6925-->    May cement their divisions, and bind up
line 6926-->    The petty difference we yet not know.
line 6927-->    Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
line 6928-->    Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
line 6929-->    Come, Menas.                                          Exeunt
line 6930-->
line 6931-->
line 6932-->
line 6933-->
line 6934-->SCENE II.
line 6935-->Rome. The house of LEPIDUS
line 6936-->
line 6937-->Enter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
line 6938-->
line 6939-->  LEPIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
line 6940-->    And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
line 6941-->    To soft and gentle speech.
line 6942-->  ENOBARBUS. I shall entreat him
line 6943-->    To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,
line 6944-->    Let Antony look over Caesar's head
line 6945-->    And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
line 6946-->    Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
line 6947-->    I would not shave't to-day.
line 6948-->  LEPIDUS. 'Tis not a time
line 6949-->    For private stomaching.
line 6950-->  ENOBARBUS. Every time
line 6951-->    Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
line 6952-->  LEPIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.
line 6953-->  ENOBARBUS. Not if the small come first.
line 6954-->  LEPIDUS. Your speech is passion;
line 6955-->    But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes  
line 6956-->    The noble Antony.
line 6957-->
line 6958-->                Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
line 6959-->
line 6960-->  ENOBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.
line 6961-->
line 6962-->            Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA
line 6963-->
line 6964-->  ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
line 6965-->    Hark, Ventidius.
line 6966-->  CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
line 6967-->  LEPIDUS. Noble friends,
line 6968-->    That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
line 6969-->    A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
line 6970-->    May it be gently heard. When we debate
line 6971-->    Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
line 6972-->    Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,
line 6973-->    The rather for I earnestly beseech,
line 6974-->    Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
line 6975-->    Nor curstness grow to th' matter.  
line 6976-->  ANTONY. 'Tis spoken well.
line 6977-->    Were we before our arinies, and to fight,
line 6978-->    I should do thus.                                 [Flourish]
line 6979-->  CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.
line 6980-->  ANTONY. Thank you.
line 6981-->  CAESAR. Sit.
line 6982-->  ANTONY. Sit, sir.
line 6983-->  CAESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
line 6984-->  ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
line 6985-->    Or being, concern you not.
line 6986-->  CAESAR. I must be laugh'd at
line 6987-->    If, or for nothing or a little,
line 6988-->    Should say myself offended, and with you
line 6989-->    Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
line 6990-->    Once name you derogately when to sound your name
line 6991-->    It not concern'd me.
line 6992-->  ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
line 6993-->    What was't to you?
line 6994-->  CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
line 6995-->    Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there  
line 6996-->    Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
line 6997-->    Might be my question.
line 6998-->  ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?
line 6999-->  CAESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
line 7000-->    By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
line 7001-->    Made wars upon me, and their contestation
line 7002-->    Was theme for you; you were the word of war.
line 7003-->  ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
line 7004-->    Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
line 7005-->    And have my learning from some true reports
line 7006-->    That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
line 7007-->    Discredit my authority with yours,
line 7008-->    And make the wars alike against my stomach,
line 7009-->    Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
line 7010-->    Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
line 7011-->    As matter whole you have not to make it with,
line 7012-->    It must not be with this.
line 7013-->  CAESAR. You praise yourself
line 7014-->    By laying defects of judgment to me; but
line 7015-->    You patch'd up your excuses.  
line 7016-->  ANTONY. Not so, not so;
line 7017-->    I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
line 7018-->    Very necessity of this thought, that I,
line 7019-->    Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
line 7020-->    Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
line 7021-->    Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
line 7022-->    I would you had her spirit in such another!
line 7023-->    The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle
line 7024-->    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
line 7025-->  ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
line 7026-->    wars with the women!
line 7027-->  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
line 7028-->    Made out of her impatience- which not wanted
line 7029-->    Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant
line 7030-->    Did you too much disquiet. For that you must
line 7031-->    But say I could not help it.
line 7032-->  CAESAR. I wrote to you
line 7033-->    When rioting in Alexandria; you
line 7034-->    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
line 7035-->    Did gibe my missive out of audience.  
line 7036-->  ANTONY. Sir,
line 7037-->    He fell upon me ere admitted. Then
line 7038-->    Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
line 7039-->    Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day
line 7040-->    I told him of myself, which was as much
line 7041-->    As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
line 7042-->    Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
line 7043-->    Out of our question wipe him.
line 7044-->  CAESAR. You have broken
line 7045-->    The article of your oath, which you shall never
line 7046-->    Have tongue to charge me with.
line 7047-->  LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
line 7048-->  ANTONY. No;
line 7049-->    Lepidus, let him speak.
line 7050-->    The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
line 7051-->    Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:
line 7052-->    The article of my oath-
line 7053-->  CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
line 7054-->    The which you both denied.
line 7055-->  ANTONY. Neglected, rather;  
line 7056-->    And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
line 7057-->    From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
line 7058-->    I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
line 7059-->    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
line 7060-->    Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
line 7061-->    To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
line 7062-->    For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
line 7063-->    So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
line 7064-->    To stoop in such a case.
line 7065-->  LEPIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.
line 7066-->  MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
line 7067-->    The griefs between ye- to forget them quite
line 7068-->    Were to remember that the present need
line 7069-->    Speaks to atone you.
line 7070-->  LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
line 7071-->  ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
line 7072-->    you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.
line 7073-->    You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
line 7074-->    do.
line 7075-->  ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.  
line 7076-->  ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
line 7077-->  ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
line 7078-->  ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
line 7079-->  CAESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
line 7080-->    The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
line 7081-->    We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
line 7082-->    So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew
line 7083-->    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
line 7084-->    O' th' world, I would pursue it.
line 7085-->  AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
line 7086-->  CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
line 7087-->  AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
line 7088-->    Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
line 7089-->    Is now a widower.
line 7090-->  CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
line 7091-->    If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
line 7092-->    Were well deserv'd of rashness.
line 7093-->  ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
line 7094-->    Agrippa further speak.
line 7095-->  AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,  
line 7096-->    To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
line 7097-->    With an unslipping knot, take Antony
line 7098-->    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
line 7099-->    No worse a husband than the best of men;
line 7100-->    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
line 7101-->    That which none else can utter. By this marriage
line 7102-->    All little jealousies, which now seem great,
line 7103-->    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
line 7104-->    Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
line 7105-->    Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both
line 7106-->    Would each to other, and all loves to both,
line 7107-->    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
line 7108-->    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
line 7109-->    By duty ruminated.
line 7110-->  ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?
line 7111-->  CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
line 7112-->    With what is spoke already.
line 7113-->  ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,
line 7114-->    If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'
line 7115-->    To make this good?  
line 7116-->  CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and
line 7117-->    His power unto Octavia.
line 7118-->  ANTONY. May I never
line 7119-->    To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
line 7120-->    Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.
line 7121-->    Further this act of grace; and from this hour
line 7122-->    The heart of brothers govern in our loves
line 7123-->    And sway our great designs!
line 7124-->  CAESAR. There is my hand.
line 7125-->    A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
line 7126-->    Did ever love so dearly. Let her live
line 7127-->    To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
line 7128-->    Fly off our loves again!
line 7129-->  LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!
line 7130-->  ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
line 7131-->    For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
line 7132-->    Of late upon me. I must thank him only,
line 7133-->    Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
line 7134-->    At heel of that, defy him.
line 7135-->  LEPIDUS. Time calls upon's.  
line 7136-->    Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
line 7137-->    Or else he seeks out us.
line 7138-->  ANTONY. Where lies he?
line 7139-->  CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
line 7140-->  ANTONY. What is his strength by land?
line 7141-->  CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea
line 7142-->    He is an absolute master.
line 7143-->  ANTONY. So is the fame.
line 7144-->    Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.
line 7145-->    Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
line 7146-->    The business we have talk'd of.
line 7147-->  CAESAR. With most gladness;
line 7148-->    And do invite you to my sister's view,
line 7149-->    Whither straight I'll lead you.
line 7150-->  ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,
line 7151-->    Not lack your company.
line 7152-->  LEPIDUS. Noble Antony,
line 7153-->    Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]
line 7154-->                     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS
line 7155-->  MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.  
line 7156-->  ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
line 7157-->    friend, Agrippa!
line 7158-->  AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
line 7159-->  MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
line 7160-->    digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.
line 7161-->  ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
line 7162-->    the night light with drinking.
line 7163-->  MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
line 7164-->    twelve persons there. Is this true?
line 7165-->  ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
line 7166-->    monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
line 7167-->  MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
line 7168-->  ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
line 7169-->    upon the river of Cydnus.
line 7170-->  AGRIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
line 7171-->    her.
line 7172-->  ENOBARBUS. I will tell you.
line 7173-->    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
line 7174-->    Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;
line 7175-->    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that  
line 7176-->    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
line 7177-->    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
line 7178-->    The water which they beat to follow faster,
line 7179-->    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
line 7180-->    It beggar'd all description. She did lie
line 7181-->    In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,
line 7182-->    O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
line 7183-->    The fancy out-work nature. On each side her
line 7184-->    Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
line 7185-->    With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
line 7186-->    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
line 7187-->    And what they undid did.
line 7188-->  AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
line 7189-->  ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
line 7190-->    So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,
line 7191-->    And made their bends adornings. At the helm
line 7192-->    A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
line 7193-->    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
line 7194-->    That yarely frame the office. From the barge
line 7195-->    A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
line 7196-->    Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
line 7197-->    Her people out upon her; and Antony,
line 7198-->    Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,
line 7199-->    Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,
line 7200-->    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
line 7201-->    And made a gap in nature.
line 7202-->  AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
line 7203-->  ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
line 7204-->    Invited her to supper. She replied
line 7205-->    It should be better he became her guest;
line 7206-->    Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
line 7207-->    Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
line 7208-->    Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
line 7209-->    And for his ordinary pays his heart
line 7210-->    For what his eyes eat only.
line 7211-->  AGRIPPA. Royal wench!
line 7212-->    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
line 7213-->    He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.
line 7214-->  ENOBARBUS. I saw her once
line 7215-->    Hop forty paces through the public street;  
line 7216-->    And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
line 7217-->    That she did make defect perfection,
line 7218-->    And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.
line 7219-->  MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
line 7220-->  ENOBARBUS. Never! He will not.
line 7221-->    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
line 7222-->    Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
line 7223-->    The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
line 7224-->    Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
line 7225-->    Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
line 7226-->    Bless her when she is riggish.
line 7227-->  MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
line 7228-->    The heart of Antony, Octavia is
line 7229-->    A blessed lottery to him.
line 7230-->  AGRIPPA. Let us go.
line 7231-->    Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
line 7232-->    Whilst you abide here.
line 7233-->  ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt

line 7238-->SCENE III.
line 7239-->Rome. CAESAR'S house
line 7240-->
line 7241-->Enter ANTONY, CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them
line 7242-->
line 7243-->  ANTONY. The world and my great office will sometimes
line 7244-->    Divide me from your bosom.
line 7245-->  OCTAVIA. All which time
line 7246-->    Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
line 7247-->    To them for you.
line 7248-->  ANTONY. Good night, sir. My Octavia,
line 7249-->    Read not my blemishes in the world's report.
line 7250-->    I have not kept my square; but that to come
line 7251-->    Shall all be done by th' rule. Good night, dear lady.
line 7252-->  OCTAVIA. Good night, sir.
line 7253-->  CAESAR. Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA
line 7254-->
line 7255-->                        Enter SOOTHSAYER
line 7256-->
line 7257-->  ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
line 7258-->  SOOTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
line 7259-->  ANTONY. If you can- your reason.  
line 7260-->  SOOTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
line 7261-->    yet hie you to Egypt again.
line 7262-->  ANTONY. Say to me,
line 7263-->    Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
line 7264-->  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar's.
line 7265-->    Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
line 7266-->    Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
line 7267-->    Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
line 7268-->    Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel
line 7269-->    Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore
line 7270-->    Make space enough between you.
line 7271-->  ANTONY. Speak this no more.
line 7272-->  SOOTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
line 7273-->    If thou dost play with him at any game,
line 7274-->    Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
line 7275-->    He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens
line 7276-->    When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
line 7277-->    Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
line 7278-->    But, he away, 'tis noble.
line 7279-->  ANTONY. Get thee gone.  
line 7280-->    Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
line 7281-->                                                 Exit SOOTHSAYER
line 7282-->    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
line 7283-->    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
line 7284-->    And in our sports my better cunning faints
line 7285-->    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
line 7286-->    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
line 7287-->    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
line 7288-->    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
line 7289-->    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
line 7290-->    I' th' East my pleasure lies.
line 7291-->
line 7292-->                       Enter VENTIDIUS
line 7293-->
line 7294-->    O, come, Ventidius,
line 7295-->    You must to Parthia. Your commission's ready;
line 7296-->    Follow me and receive't.                              Exeunt

line 7301-->SCENE IV.
line 7302-->Rome. A street
line 7303-->
line 7304-->Enter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA
line 7305-->
line 7306-->  LEPIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
line 7307-->    Your generals after.
line 7308-->  AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony
line 7309-->    Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
line 7310-->  LEPIDUS. Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
line 7311-->    Which will become you both, farewell.
line 7312-->  MAECENAS. We shall,
line 7313-->    As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount
line 7314-->    Before you, Lepidus.
line 7315-->  LEPIDUS. Your way is shorter;
line 7316-->    My purposes do draw me much about.
line 7317-->    You'll win two days upon me.
line 7318-->  BOTH. Sir, good success!
line 7319-->  LEPIDUS. Farewell.                                      Exeunt

line 7323-->
line 7324-->SCENE V.
line 7325-->Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
line 7326-->
line 7327-->Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
line 7328-->
line 7329-->  CLEOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food
line 7330-->    Of us that trade in love.
line 7331-->  ALL. The music, ho!
line 7332-->
line 7333-->                    Enter MARDIAN the eunuch
line 7334-->
line 7335-->  CLEOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
line 7336-->  CHARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
line 7337-->  CLEOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
line 7338-->    As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
line 7339-->  MARDIAN. As well as I can, madam.
line 7340-->  CLEOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
line 7341-->    The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.
line 7342-->    Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,
line 7343-->    My music playing far off, I will betray
line 7344-->    Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
line 7345-->    Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up
line 7346-->    I'll think them every one an Antony,
line 7347-->    And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'
line 7348-->  CHARMIAN. 'Twas merry when
line 7349-->    You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
line 7350-->    Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
line 7351-->    With fervency drew up.
line 7352-->  CLEOPATRA. That time? O times
line 7353-->    I laughed him out of patience; and that night
line 7354-->    I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
line 7355-->    Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
line 7356-->    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
line 7357-->    I wore his sword Philippan.
line 7358-->
line 7359-->                    Enter a MESSENGER
line 7360-->
line 7361-->    O! from Italy?
line 7362-->    Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
line 7363-->    That long time have been barren.
line 7364-->  MESSENGER. Madam, madam-
line 7365-->  CLEOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,  
line 7366-->    Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
line 7367-->    If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
line 7368-->    My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings
line 7369-->    Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
line 7370-->  MESSENGER. First, madam, he is well.
line 7371-->  CLEOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.
line 7372-->    But, sirrah, mark, we use
line 7373-->    To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
line 7374-->    The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
line 7375-->    Down thy ill-uttering throat.
line 7376-->  MESSENGER. Good madam, hear me.
line 7377-->  CLEOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.
line 7378-->    But there's no goodness in thy face. If Antony
line 7379-->    Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour
line 7380-->    To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,
line 7381-->    Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
line 7382-->    Not like a formal man.
line 7383-->  MESSENGER. Will't please you hear me?
line 7384-->  CLEOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
line 7385-->    Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,  
line 7386-->    Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
line 7387-->    I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
line 7388-->    Rich pearls upon thee.
line 7389-->  MESSENGER. Madam, he's well.
line 7390-->  CLEOPATRA. Well said.
line 7391-->  MESSENGER. And friends with Caesar.
line 7392-->  CLEOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.
line 7393-->  MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
line 7394-->  CLEOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.
line 7395-->  MESSENGER. But yet, madam-
line 7396-->  CLEOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
line 7397-->    The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!
line 7398-->    'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
line 7399-->    Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
line 7400-->    Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
line 7401-->    The good and bad together. He's friends with Caesar;
line 7402-->    In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free.
line 7403-->  MESSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
line 7404-->    He's bound unto Octavia.
line 7405-->  CLEOPATRA. For what good turn?  
line 7406-->  MESSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.
line 7407-->  CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.
line 7408-->  MESSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.
line 7409-->  CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
line 7410-->                                              [Strikes him down]
line 7411-->  MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.
line 7412-->  CLEOPATRA. What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]
line 7413-->    Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
line 7414-->    Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;
line 7415-->                                     [She hales him up and down]
line 7416-->    Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,
line 7417-->    Smarting in ling'ring pickle.
line 7418-->  MESSENGER. Gracious madam,
line 7419-->    I that do bring the news made not the match.
line 7420-->  CLEOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
line 7421-->    And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
line 7422-->    Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
line 7423-->    And I will boot thee with what gift beside
line 7424-->    Thy modesty can beg.
line 7425-->  MESSENGER. He's married, madam.  
line 7426-->  CLEOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]
line 7427-->  MESSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.
line 7428-->    What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.             Exit
line 7429-->  CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
line 7430-->    The man is innocent.
line 7431-->  CLEOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
line 7432-->    Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
line 7433-->    Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.
line 7434-->    Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!
line 7435-->  CHARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
line 7436-->  CLEOPATRA. I will not hurt him.
line 7437-->    These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
line 7438-->    A meaner than myself; since I myself
line 7439-->    Have given myself the cause.
line 7440-->
line 7441-->                    Enter the MESSENGER again
line 7442-->
line 7443-->    Come hither, sir.
line 7444-->    Though it be honest, it is never good
line 7445-->    To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message  
line 7446-->    An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
line 7447-->    Themselves when they be felt.
line 7448-->  MESSENGER. I have done my duty.
line 7449-->  CLEOPATRA. Is he married?
line 7450-->    I cannot hate thee worser than I do
line 7451-->    If thou again say 'Yes.'
line 7452-->  MESSENGER. He's married, madam.
line 7453-->  CLEOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
line 7454-->  MESSENGER. Should I lie, madam?
line 7455-->  CLEOPATRA. O, I would thou didst,
line 7456-->    So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
line 7457-->    A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
line 7458-->    Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
line 7459-->    Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
line 7460-->  MESSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.
line 7461-->  CLEOPATRA. He is married?
line 7462-->  MESSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;
line 7463-->    To punish me for what you make me do
line 7464-->    Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.
line 7465-->  CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee  
line 7466-->    That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee hence.
line 7467-->    The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
line 7468-->    Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,
line 7469-->    And be undone by 'em!                         Exit MESSENGER
line 7470-->  CHARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.
line 7471-->  CLEOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
line 7472-->  CHARMIAN. Many times, madam.
line 7473-->  CLEOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,
line 7474-->    I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.
line 7475-->    Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
line 7476-->    Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
line 7477-->    Her inclination; let him not leave out
line 7478-->    The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.
line 7479-->                                                     Exit ALEXAS
line 7480-->    Let him for ever go- let him not, Charmian-
line 7481-->    Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
line 7482-->    The other way's a Mars.                         [To MARDIAN]
line 7483-->    Bid you Alexas
line 7484-->    Bring me word how tall she is.- Pity me, Charmian,
line 7485-->    But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.        Exeunt
line 7486-->
line 7487-->
line 7488-->
line 7489-->
line 7490-->SCENE VI.
line 7491-->Near Misenum
line 7492-->
line 7493-->Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet;
line 7494-->at another, CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, AGRIPPA,
line 7495-->with soldiers marching
line 7496-->
line 7497-->  POMPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
line 7498-->    And we shall talk before we fight.
line 7499-->  CAESAR. Most meet
line 7500-->    That first we come to words; and therefore have we
line 7501-->    Our written purposes before us sent;
line 7502-->    Which if thou hast considered, let us know
line 7503-->    If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
line 7504-->    And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
line 7505-->    That else must perish here.
line 7506-->  POMPEY. To you all three,
line 7507-->    The senators alone of this great world,
line 7508-->    Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
line 7509-->    Wherefore my father should revengers want,
line 7510-->    Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,  
line 7511-->    Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
line 7512-->    There saw you labouring for him. What was't
line 7513-->    That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
line 7514-->    Made the all-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus,
line 7515-->    With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
line 7516-->    To drench the Capitol, but that they would
line 7517-->    Have one man but a man? And that is it
line 7518-->    Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
line 7519-->    The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
line 7520-->    To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome
line 7521-->    Cast on my noble father.
line 7522-->  CAESAR. Take your time.
line 7523-->  ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
line 7524-->    We'll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know'st
line 7525-->    How much we do o'er-count thee.
line 7526-->  POMPEY. At land, indeed,
line 7527-->    Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house.
line 7528-->    But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
line 7529-->    Remain in't as thou mayst.
line 7530-->  LEPIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-  
line 7531-->    For this is from the present- how you take
line 7532-->    The offers we have sent you.
line 7533-->  CAESAR. There's the point.
line 7534-->  ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
line 7535-->    What it is worth embrac'd.
line 7536-->  CAESAR. And what may follow,
line 7537-->    To try a larger fortune.
line 7538-->  POMPEY. You have made me offer
line 7539-->    Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
line 7540-->    Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send
line 7541-->    Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
line 7542-->    To part with unhack'd edges and bear back
line 7543-->    Our targes undinted.
line 7544-->  ALL. That's our offer.
line 7545-->  POMPEY. Know, then,
line 7546-->    I came before you here a man prepar'd
line 7547-->    To take this offer; but Mark Antony
line 7548-->    Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
line 7549-->    The praise of it by telling, you must know,
line 7550-->    When Caesar and your brother were at blows,  
line 7551-->    Your mother came to Sicily and did find
line 7552-->    Her welcome friendly.
line 7553-->  ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
line 7554-->    And am well studied for a liberal thanks
line 7555-->    Which I do owe you.
line 7556-->  POMPEY. Let me have your hand.
line 7557-->    I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
line 7558-->  ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
line 7559-->    That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
line 7560-->    For I have gained by't.
line 7561-->  CAESAR. Since I saw you last
line 7562-->    There is a change upon you.
line 7563-->  POMPEY. Well, I know not
line 7564-->    What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
line 7565-->    But in my bosom shall she never come
line 7566-->    To make my heart her vassal.
line 7567-->  LEPIDUS. Well met here.
line 7568-->  POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
line 7569-->    I crave our composition may be written,
line 7570-->    And seal'd between us.  
line 7571-->  CAESAR. That's the next to do.
line 7572-->  POMPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
line 7573-->    Draw lots who shall begin.
line 7574-->  ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.
line 7575-->  POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;
line 7576-->    But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
line 7577-->    Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
line 7578-->    Grew fat with feasting there.
line 7579-->  ANTONY. You have heard much.
line 7580-->  POMPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.
line 7581-->  ANTONY. And fair words to them.
line 7582-->  POMPEY. Then so much have I heard;
line 7583-->    And I have heard Apollodorus carried-
line 7584-->  ENOBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.
line 7585-->  POMPEY. What, I pray you?
line 7586-->  ENOBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
line 7587-->  POMPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
line 7588-->  ENOBARBUS. Well;
line 7589-->    And well am like to do, for I perceive
line 7590-->    Four feasts are toward.  
line 7591-->  POMPEY. Let me shake thy hand.
line 7592-->    I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,
line 7593-->    When I have envied thy behaviour.
line 7594-->  ENOBARBUS. Sir,
line 7595-->    I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye
line 7596-->    When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
line 7597-->    As I have said you did.
line 7598-->  POMPEY. Enjoy thy plainness;
line 7599-->    It nothing ill becomes thee.
line 7600-->    Aboard my galley I invite you all.
line 7601-->    Will you lead, lords?
line 7602-->  ALL. Show's the way, sir.
line 7603-->  POMPEY. Come.               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
line 7604-->  MENAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this
line 7605-->    treaty.- You and I have known, sir.
line 7606-->  ENOBARBUS. At sea, I think.
line 7607-->  MENAS. We have, sir.
line 7608-->  ENOBARBUS. You have done well by water.
line 7609-->  MENAS. And you by land.
line 7610-->  ENOBARBUS. I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it  
line 7611-->    cannot be denied what I have done by land.
line 7612-->  MENAS. Nor what I have done by water.
line 7613-->  ENOBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
line 7614-->    have been a great thief by sea.
line 7615-->  MENAS. And you by land.
line 7616-->  ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
line 7617-->    Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two
line 7618-->    thieves kissing.
line 7619-->  MENAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
line 7620-->  ENOBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
line 7621-->  MENAS. No slander: they steal hearts.
line 7622-->  ENOBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
line 7623-->  MENAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
line 7624-->    Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
line 7625-->  ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
line 7626-->  MENAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
line 7627-->    you, is he married to Cleopatra?
line 7628-->  ENOBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
line 7629-->  MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
line 7630-->  ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.  
line 7631-->  MENAS. Pray ye, sir?
line 7632-->  ENOBARBUS. 'Tis true.
line 7633-->  MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
line 7634-->  ENOBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not
line 7635-->    prophesy so.
line 7636-->  MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
line 7637-->    than the love of the parties.
line 7638-->  ENOBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems
line 7639-->    to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
line 7640-->    their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
line 7641-->  MENAS. Who would not have his wife so?
line 7642-->  ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He
line 7643-->    will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia
line 7644-->    blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is
line 7645-->    the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
line 7646-->    their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he
line 7647-->    married but his occasion here.
line 7648-->  MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a
line 7649-->    health for you.
line 7650-->  ENOBARBUS. I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.  
line 7651-->  MENAS. Come, let's away.                                Exeunt
line 7652-->
line 7653-->ACT_2|SC_7
line 7654-->                           SCENE VII.
line 7655-->             On board POMPEY'S galley, off Misenum
line 7656-->
line 7657-->     Music plays. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet
line 7658-->
line 7659-->  FIRST SERVANT. Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
line 7660-->    ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them
line 7661-->    down.
line 7662-->  SECOND SERVANT. Lepidus is high-colour'd.
line 7663-->  FIRST SERVANT. They have made him drink alms-drink.
line 7664-->  SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
line 7665-->    cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself
line 7666-->    to th' drink.
line 7667-->  FIRST SERVANT. But it raises the greater war between him and his
line 7668-->    discretion.
line 7669-->  SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in great men's
line 7670-->    fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service
line 7671-->    as a partizan I could not heave.
line 7672-->  FIRST SERVANT. To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
line 7673-->    to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully
line 7674-->    disaster the cheeks.
line 7675-->  
line 7676-->           A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
line 7677-->            POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS,
line 7678-->                         with other CAPTAINS
line 7679-->
line 7680-->  ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
line 7681-->      Nile
line 7682-->    By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know
line 7683-->    By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
line 7684-->    Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells
line 7685-->    The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
line 7686-->    Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
line 7687-->    And shortly comes to harvest.
line 7688-->  LEPIDUS. Y'have strange serpents there.
line 7689-->  ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.
line 7690-->  LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
line 7691-->    operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
line 7692-->  ANTONY. They are so.
line 7693-->  POMPEY. Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
line 7694-->  LEPIDUS. I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
line 7695-->  ENOBARBUS. Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till  
line 7696-->    then.
line 7697-->  LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are
line 7698-->    very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.
line 7699-->  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
line 7700-->  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?
line 7701-->  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
line 7702-->      Captain,
line 7703-->    And hear me speak a word.
line 7704-->  POMPEY. [ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-
line 7705-->    This wine for Lepidus!
line 7706-->  LEPIDUS. What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
line 7707-->  ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it
line 7708-->    hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own
line 7709-->    organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements
line 7710-->    once out of it, it transmigrates.
line 7711-->  LEPIDUS. What colour is it of?
line 7712-->  ANTONY. Of it own colour too.
line 7713-->  LEPIDUS. 'Tis a strange serpent.
line 7714-->  ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
line 7715-->  CAESAR. Will this description satisfy him?  
line 7716-->  ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
line 7717-->    epicure.
line 7718-->  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!
line 7719-->      Away!
line 7720-->    Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I call'd for?
line 7721-->  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear
line 7722-->      me,
line 7723-->    Rise from thy stool.
line 7724-->  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks
line 7725-->    aside] The matter?
line 7726-->  MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
line 7727-->  POMPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
line 7728-->    Be jolly, lords.
line 7729-->  ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,
line 7730-->    Keep off them, for you sink.
line 7731-->  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
line 7732-->  POMPEY. What say'st thou?
line 7733-->  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
line 7734-->  POMPEY. How should that be?
line 7735-->  MENAS. But entertain it,  
line 7736-->    And though you think me poor, I am the man
line 7737-->    Will give thee all the world.
line 7738-->  POMPEY. Hast thou drunk well?
line 7739-->  MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
line 7740-->    Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;
line 7741-->    Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
line 7742-->    Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
line 7743-->  POMPEY. Show me which way.
line 7744-->  MENAS. These three world-sharers, these competitors,
line 7745-->    Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;
line 7746-->    And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
line 7747-->    All there is thine.
line 7748-->  POMPEY. Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
line 7749-->    And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:
line 7750-->    In thee't had been good service. Thou must know
line 7751-->    'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
line 7752-->    Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
line 7753-->    Hath so betray'd thine act. Being done unknown,
line 7754-->    I should have found it afterwards well done,
line 7755-->    But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.  
line 7756-->  MENAS. [Aside] For this,
line 7757-->    I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
line 7758-->    Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
line 7759-->    Shall never find it more.
line 7760-->  POMPEY. This health to Lepidus!
line 7761-->  ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
line 7762-->  ENOBARBUS. Here's to thee, Menas!
line 7763-->  MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome!
line 7764-->  POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid.
line 7765-->  ENOBARBUS. There's a strong fellow, Menas.
line 7766-->               [Pointing to the servant who carries off LEPIDUS]
line 7767-->  MENAS. Why?
line 7768-->  ENOBARBUS. 'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
line 7769-->  MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,
line 7770-->    That it might go on wheels!
line 7771-->  ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels.
line 7772-->  MENAS. Come.
line 7773-->  POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
line 7774-->  ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
line 7775-->    Here's to Caesar!  
line 7776-->  CAESAR. I could well forbear't.
line 7777-->    It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain
line 7778-->    And it grows fouler.
line 7779-->  ANTONY. Be a child o' th' time.
line 7780-->  CAESAR. Possess it, I'll make answer.
line 7781-->    But I had rather fast from all four days
line 7782-->    Than drink so much in one.
line 7783-->  ENOBARBUS. [To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!
line 7784-->    Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
line 7785-->    And celebrate our drink?
line 7786-->  POMPEY. Let's ha't, good soldier.
line 7787-->  ANTONY. Come, let's all take hands,
line 7788-->    Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
line 7789-->    In soft and delicate Lethe.
line 7790-->  ENOBARBUS. All take hands.
line 7791-->    Make battery to our ears with the loud music,
line 7792-->    The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing;
line 7793-->    The holding every man shall bear as loud
line 7794-->    As his strong sides can volley.
line 7795-->               [Music plays. ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand]  
line 7796-->
line 7797-->                        THE SONG
line 7798-->            Come, thou monarch of the vine,
line 7799-->            Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
line 7800-->            In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
line 7801-->            With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd.
line 7802-->            Cup us till the world go round,
line 7803-->            Cup us till the world go round!
line 7804-->
line 7805-->  CAESAR. What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
line 7806-->    Let me request you off; our graver business
line 7807-->    Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
line 7808-->    You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb
line 7809-->    Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
line 7810-->    Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost
line 7811-->    Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
line 7812-->    Good Antony, your hand.
line 7813-->  POMPEY. I'll try you on the shore.
line 7814-->  ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give's your hand.
line 7815-->  POMPEY. O Antony,  
line 7816-->    You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.
line 7817-->    Come, down into the boat.
line 7818-->  ENOBARBUS. Take heed you fall not.
line 7819-->                              Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
line 7820-->    Menas, I'll not on shore.
line 7821-->  MENAS. No, to my cabin.
line 7822-->    These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
line 7823-->    Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
line 7824-->    To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!
line 7825-->                                  [Sound a flourish, with drums]
line 7826-->  ENOBARBUS. Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.
line 7827-->  MENAS. Hoo! Noble Captain, come.                        Exeunt
line 7828-->ACT_3|SC_1
line 7829-->                     ACT III. SCENE I.
line 7830-->                     A plain in Syria
line 7831-->
line 7832-->       Enter VENTIDIUS, as it were in triumph, with SILIUS
line 7833-->      and other Romans, OFFICERS and soldiers; the dead body
line 7834-->                of PACORUS borne before him
line 7835-->
line 7836-->  VENTIDIUS. Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
line 7837-->    Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
line 7838-->    Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body
line 7839-->    Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
line 7840-->    Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
line 7841-->  SILIUS. Noble Ventidius,
line 7842-->    Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm
line 7843-->    The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
line 7844-->    Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
line 7845-->    The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
line 7846-->    Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
line 7847-->    Put garlands on thy head.
line 7848-->  VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius,
line 7849-->    I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
line 7850-->    May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius:  
line 7851-->    Better to leave undone than by our deed
line 7852-->    Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
line 7853-->    Caesar and Antony have ever won
line 7854-->    More in their officer, than person. Sossius,
line 7855-->    One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
line 7856-->    For quick accumulation of renown,
line 7857-->    Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour.
line 7858-->    Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
line 7859-->    Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
line 7860-->    The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
line 7861-->    Than gain which darkens him.
line 7862-->    I could do more to do Antonius good,
line 7863-->    But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
line 7864-->    Should my performance perish.
line 7865-->  SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that
line 7866-->    Without the which a soldier and his sword
line 7867-->    Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?
line 7868-->  VENTIDIUS. I'll humbly signify what in his name,
line 7869-->    That magical word of war, we have effected;
line 7870-->    How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,  
line 7871-->    The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
line 7872-->    We have jaded out o' th' field.
line 7873-->  SILIUS. Where is he now?
line 7874-->  VENTIDIUS. He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
line 7875-->    The weight we must convey with's will permit,
line 7876-->    We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.
line 7877-->                                                          Exeunt
line 7878-->
line 7879-->ACT_3|SC_2
line 7880-->                            SCENE II. Rome. CAESAR'S house
line 7881-->
line 7882-->        Enter AGRIPPA at one door, ENOBARBUS at another
line 7883-->
line 7884-->  AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted?
line 7885-->  ENOBARBUS. They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
line 7886-->    The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
line 7887-->    To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
line 7888-->    Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
line 7889-->    With the green sickness.
line 7890-->  AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.
line 7891-->  ENOBARBUS. A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!
line 7892-->  AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
line 7893-->  ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
line 7894-->  AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
line 7895-->  ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!
line 7896-->  AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
line 7897-->  ENOBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.
line 7898-->  AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
line 7899-->  ENOBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.
line 7900-->    Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot  
line 7901-->    Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-
line 7902-->    His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
line 7903-->    Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
line 7904-->  AGRIPPA. Both he loves.
line 7905-->  ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets
line 7906-->      within] So-
line 7907-->    This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
line 7908-->  AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
line 7909-->
line 7910-->           Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA
line 7911-->
line 7912-->  ANTONY. No further, sir.
line 7913-->  CAESAR. You take from me a great part of myself;
line 7914-->    Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife
line 7915-->    As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
line 7916-->    Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
line 7917-->    Let not the piece of virtue which is set
line 7918-->    Betwixt us as the cement of our love
line 7919-->    To keep it builded be the ram to batter
line 7920-->    The fortress of it; for better might we  
line 7921-->    Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts
line 7922-->    This be not cherish'd.
line 7923-->  ANTONY. Make me not offended
line 7924-->    In your distrust.
line 7925-->  CAESAR. I have said.
line 7926-->  ANTONY. You shall not find,
line 7927-->    Though you be therein curious, the least cause
line 7928-->    For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,
line 7929-->    And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
line 7930-->    We will here part.
line 7931-->  CAESAR. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
line 7932-->    The elements be kind to thee and make
line 7933-->    Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.
line 7934-->  OCTAVIA. My noble brother!
line 7935-->  ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,
line 7936-->    And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
line 7937-->  OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-
line 7938-->  CAESAR. What, Octavia?
line 7939-->  OCTAVIA. I'll tell you in your ear.
line 7940-->  ANTONY. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can  
line 7941-->    Her heart inform her tongue- the swan's down feather,
line 7942-->    That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,
line 7943-->    And neither way inclines.
line 7944-->  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
line 7945-->  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
line 7946-->  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a
line 7947-->      horse;
line 7948-->    So is he, being a man.
line 7949-->  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
line 7950-->    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
line 7951-->    He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
line 7952-->    When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
line 7953-->  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was troubled
line 7954-->      with a rheum;
line 7955-->    What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
line 7956-->    Believe't- till I weep too.
line 7957-->  CAESAR. No, sweet Octavia,
line 7958-->    You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
line 7959-->    Out-go my thinking on you.
line 7960-->  ANTONY. Come, sir, come;  
line 7961-->    I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love.
line 7962-->    Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
line 7963-->    And give you to the gods.
line 7964-->  CAESAR. Adieu; be happy!
line 7965-->  LEPIDUS. Let all the number of the stars give light
line 7966-->    To thy fair way!
line 7967-->  CAESAR. Farewell, farewell!                   [Kisses OCTAVIA]
line 7968-->  ANTONY. Farewell!                       Trumpets sound. Exeunt

line 7972-->              Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
line 7973-->
line 7974-->         Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
line 7975-->
line 7976-->  CLEOPATRA. Where is the fellow?
line 7977-->  ALEXAS. Half afeard to come.
line 7978-->  CLEOPATRA. Go to, go to.
line 7979-->
line 7980-->                Enter the MESSENGER as before
line 7981-->
line 7982-->    Come hither, sir.
line 7983-->  ALEXAS. Good Majesty,
line 7984-->    Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
line 7985-->    But when you are well pleas'd.
line 7986-->  CLEOPATRA. That Herod's head
line 7987-->    I'll have. But how, when Antony is gone,
line 7988-->    Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
line 7989-->  MESSENGER. Most gracious Majesty!
line 7990-->  CLEOPATRA. Didst thou behold Octavia?
line 7991-->  MESSENGER. Ay, dread Queen.
line 7992-->  CLEOPATRA. Where?  
line 7993-->  MESSENGER. Madam, in Rome
line 7994-->    I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
line 7995-->    Between her brother and Mark Antony.
line 7996-->  CLEOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?
line 7997-->  MESSENGER. She is not, madam.
line 7998-->  CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
line 7999-->  MESSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
line 8000-->  CLEOPATRA. That's not so good. He cannot like her long.
line 8001-->  CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
line 8002-->  CLEOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!
line 8003-->    What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
line 8004-->    If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
line 8005-->  MESSENGER. She creeps.
line 8006-->    Her motion and her station are as one;
line 8007-->    She shows a body rather than a life,
line 8008-->    A statue than a breather.
line 8009-->  CLEOPATRA. Is this certain?
line 8010-->  MESSENGER. Or I have no observance.
line 8011-->  CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt
line 8012-->    Cannot make better note.  
line 8013-->  CLEOPATRA. He's very knowing;
line 8014-->    I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet.
line 8015-->    The fellow has good judgment.
line 8016-->  CHARMIAN. Excellent.
line 8017-->  CLEOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.
line 8018-->  MESSENGER. Madam,
line 8019-->    She was a widow.
line 8020-->  CLEOPATRA. Widow? Charmian, hark!
line 8021-->  MESSENGER. And I do think she's thirty.
line 8022-->  CLEOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?
line 8023-->  MESSENGER. Round even to faultiness.
line 8024-->  CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
line 8025-->    Her hair, what colour?
line 8026-->  MESSENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead
line 8027-->    As low as she would wish it.
line 8028-->  CLEOPATRA. There's gold for thee.
line 8029-->    Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
line 8030-->    I will employ thee back again; I find thee
line 8031-->    Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;
line 8032-->    Our letters are prepar'd.                   Exeunt MESSENGER  
line 8033-->  CHARMIAN. A proper man.
line 8034-->  CLEOPATRA. Indeed, he is so. I repent me much
line 8035-->    That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
line 8036-->    This creature's no such thing.
line 8037-->  CHARMIAN. Nothing, madam.
line 8038-->  CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
line 8039-->  CHARMIAN. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
line 8040-->    And serving you so long!
line 8041-->  CLEOPATRA. I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.
line 8042-->    But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
line 8043-->    Where I will write. All may be well enough.
line 8044-->  CHARMIAN. I warrant you, madam.                         Exeunt

line 8049-->
line 8050-->                 Enter ANTONY and OCTAVIA
line 8051-->
line 8052-->  ANTONY. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
line 8053-->    That were excusable, that and thousands more
line 8054-->    Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd
line 8055-->    New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
line 8056-->    To public ear;
line 8057-->    Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not
line 8058-->    But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
line 8059-->    He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;
line 8060-->    When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
line 8061-->    Or did it from his teeth.
line 8062-->  OCTAVIA. O my good lord,
line 8063-->    Believe not all; or if you must believe,
line 8064-->    Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
line 8065-->    If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
line 8066-->    Praying for both parts.
line 8067-->    The good gods will mock me presently
line 8068-->    When I shall pray 'O, bless my lord and husband!'  
line 8069-->    Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
line 8070-->    'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
line 8071-->    Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way
line 8072-->    'Twixt these extremes at all.
line 8073-->  ANTONY. Gentle Octavia,
line 8074-->    Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
line 8075-->    Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,
line 8076-->    I lose myself; better I were not yours
line 8077-->    Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
line 8078-->    Yourself shall go between's. The meantime, lady,
line 8079-->    I'll raise the preparation of a war
line 8080-->    Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste;
line 8081-->    So your desires are yours.
line 8082-->  OCTAVIA. Thanks to my lord.
line 8083-->    The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,
line 8084-->    Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
line 8085-->    As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
line 8086-->    Should solder up the rift.
line 8087-->  ANTONY. When it appears to you where this begins,
line 8088-->    Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults  
line 8089-->    Can never be so equal that your love
line 8090-->    Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
line 8091-->    Choose your own company, and command what cost
line 8092-->    Your heart has mind to.                               Exeunt

line 8096-->                   Athens. ANTONY'S house
line 8097-->
line 8098-->             Enter ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting
line 8099-->
line 8100-->  ENOBARBUS. How now, friend Eros!
line 8101-->  EROS. There's strange news come, sir.
line 8102-->  ENOBARBUS. What, man?
line 8103-->  EROS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
line 8104-->  ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the success?
line 8105-->  EROS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
line 8106-->    presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the
line 8107-->    glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters
line 8108-->    he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.
line 8109-->    So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
line 8110-->  ENOBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
line 8111-->    And throw between them all the food thou hast,
line 8112-->    They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
line 8113-->  EROS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns
line 8114-->    The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'
line 8115-->    And threats the throat of that his officer
line 8116-->    That murd'red Pompey.  
line 8117-->  ENOBARBUS. Our great navy's rigg'd.
line 8118-->  EROS. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
line 8119-->    My lord desires you presently; my news
line 8120-->    I might have told hereafter.
line 8121-->  ENOBARBUS. 'Twill be naught;
line 8122-->    But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
line 8123-->  EROS. Come, sir.                                        Exeunt

line 8126-->                          SCENE VI.
line 8127-->                   Rome. CAESAR'S house
line 8128-->
line 8129-->             Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS
line 8130-->
line 8131-->  CAESAR. Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
line 8132-->    In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:
line 8133-->    I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
line 8134-->    Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
line 8135-->    Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat
line 8136-->    Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
line 8137-->    And all the unlawful issue that their lust
line 8138-->    Since then hath made between them. Unto her
line 8139-->    He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
line 8140-->    Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
line 8141-->    Absolute queen.
line 8142-->  MAECENAS. This in the public eye?
line 8143-->  CAESAR. I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.
line 8144-->    His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
line 8145-->    Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,
line 8146-->    He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
line 8147-->    Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She  
line 8148-->    In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis
line 8149-->    That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
line 8150-->    As 'tis reported, so.
line 8151-->  MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus
line 8152-->    Inform'd.
line 8153-->  AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence
line 8154-->    Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
line 8155-->  CAESAR. The people knows it, and have now receiv'd
line 8156-->    His accusations.
line 8157-->  AGRIPPA. Who does he accuse?
line 8158-->  CAESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
line 8159-->    Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
line 8160-->    His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me
line 8161-->    Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets
line 8162-->    That Lepidus of the triumvirate
line 8163-->    Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain
line 8164-->    All his revenue.
line 8165-->  AGRIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.
line 8166-->  CAESAR. 'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
line 8167-->    I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,  
line 8168-->    That he his high authority abus'd,
line 8169-->    And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd
line 8170-->    I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia
line 8171-->    And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,
line 8172-->    Demand the like.
line 8173-->  MAECENAS. He'll never yield to that.
line 8174-->  CAESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
line 8175-->
line 8176-->                Enter OCTAVIA, with her train
line 8177-->
line 8178-->  OCTAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
line 8179-->  CAESAR. That ever I should call thee cast-away!
line 8180-->  OCTAVIA. You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
line 8181-->  CAESAR. Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
line 8182-->    Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony
line 8183-->    Should have an army for an usher, and
line 8184-->    The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
line 8185-->    Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way
line 8186-->    Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
line 8187-->    Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust  
line 8188-->    Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
line 8189-->    Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
line 8190-->    A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
line 8191-->    The ostentation of our love, which left unshown
line 8192-->    Is often left unlov'd. We should have met you
line 8193-->    By sea and land, supplying every stage
line 8194-->    With an augmented greeting.
line 8195-->  OCTAVIA. Good my lord,
line 8196-->    To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
line 8197-->    On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
line 8198-->    Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
line 8199-->    My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd
line 8200-->    His pardon for return.
line 8201-->  CAESAR. Which soon he granted,
line 8202-->    Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
line 8203-->  OCTAVIA. Do not say so, my lord.
line 8204-->  CAESAR. I have eyes upon him,
line 8205-->    And his affairs come to me on the wind.
line 8206-->    Where is he now?
line 8207-->  OCTAVIA. My lord, in Athens.  
line 8208-->  CAESAR. No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra
line 8209-->    Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
line 8210-->    Up to a whore, who now are levying
line 8211-->    The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled
line 8212-->    Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus
line 8213-->    Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
line 8214-->    Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
line 8215-->    King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
line 8216-->    Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
line 8217-->    Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
line 8218-->    The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with
line 8219-->    More larger list of sceptres.
line 8220-->  OCTAVIA. Ay me most wretched,
line 8221-->    That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,
line 8222-->    That does afflict each other!
line 8223-->  CAESAR. Welcome hither.
line 8224-->    Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
line 8225-->    Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led
line 8226-->    And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
line 8227-->    Be you not troubled with the time, which drives  
line 8228-->    O'er your content these strong necessities,
line 8229-->    But let determin'd things to destiny
line 8230-->    Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
line 8231-->    Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd
line 8232-->    Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
line 8233-->    To do you justice, make their ministers
line 8234-->    Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
line 8235-->    And ever welcome to us.
line 8236-->  AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.
line 8237-->  MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam.
line 8238-->    Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
line 8239-->    Only th' adulterous Antony, most large
line 8240-->    In his abominations, turns you off,
line 8241-->    And gives his potent regiment to a trull
line 8242-->    That noises it against us.
line 8243-->  OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir?
line 8244-->  CAESAR. Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
line 8245-->    Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister!         Exeunt

line 8250-->
line 8251-->                Enter CLEOPATRA and ENOBARBUS
line 8252-->
line 8253-->  CLEOPATRA. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
line 8254-->  ENOBARBUS. But why, why,
line 8255-->  CLEOPATRA. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
line 8256-->    And say'st it is not fit.
line 8257-->  ENOBARBUS. Well, is it, is it?
line 8258-->  CLEOPATRA. Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we
line 8259-->    Be there in person?
line 8260-->  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I could reply:
line 8261-->    If we should serve with horse and mares together
line 8262-->    The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
line 8263-->    A soldier and his horse.
line 8264-->  CLEOPATRA. What is't you say?
line 8265-->  ENOBARBUS. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
line 8266-->    Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,
line 8267-->    What should not then be spar'd. He is already
line 8268-->    Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
line 8269-->    That Photinus an eunuch and your maids  
line 8270-->    Manage this war.
line 8271-->  CLEOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
line 8272-->    That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war,
line 8273-->    And, as the president of my kingdom, will
line 8274-->    Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;
line 8275-->    I will not stay behind.
line 8276-->
line 8277-->                   Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS
line 8278-->
line 8279-->  ENOBARBUS. Nay, I have done.
line 8280-->    Here comes the Emperor.
line 8281-->  ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,
line 8282-->    That from Tarentum and Brundusium
line 8283-->    He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
line 8284-->    And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, sweet?
line 8285-->  CLEOPATRA. Celerity is never more admir'd
line 8286-->    Than by the negligent.
line 8287-->  ANTONY. A good rebuke,
line 8288-->    Which might have well becom'd the best of men
line 8289-->    To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we  
line 8290-->    Will fight with him by sea.
line 8291-->  CLEOPATRA. By sea! What else?
line 8292-->  CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?
line 8293-->  ANTONY. For that he dares us to't.
line 8294-->  ENOBARBUS. So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
line 8295-->  CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
line 8296-->    Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,
line 8297-->    Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
line 8298-->    And so should you.
line 8299-->  ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann'd;
line 8300-->    Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people
line 8301-->    Ingross'd by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet
line 8302-->    Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;
line 8303-->    Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace
line 8304-->    Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
line 8305-->    Being prepar'd for land.
line 8306-->  ANTONY. By sea, by sea.
line 8307-->  ENOBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
line 8308-->    The absolute soldiership you have by land;
line 8309-->    Distract your army, which doth most consist  
line 8310-->    Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
line 8311-->    Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo
line 8312-->    The way which promises assurance; and
line 8313-->    Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
line 8314-->    From firm security.
line 8315-->  ANTONY. I'll fight at sea.
line 8316-->  CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
line 8317-->  ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
line 8318-->    And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
line 8319-->    Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
line 8320-->    We then can do't at land.
line 8321-->
line 8322-->                       Enter a MESSENGER
line 8323-->
line 8324-->    Thy business?
line 8325-->  MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
line 8326-->    Caesar has taken Toryne.
line 8327-->  ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
line 8328-->    Strange that his power should be. Canidius,
line 8329-->    Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,  
line 8330-->    And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.
line 8331-->    Away, my Thetis!
line 8332-->
line 8333-->                       Enter a SOLDIER
line 8334-->
line 8335-->    How now, worthy soldier?
line 8336-->  SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
line 8337-->    Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt
line 8338-->    This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians
line 8339-->    And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
line 8340-->    Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth
line 8341-->    And fighting foot to foot.
line 8342-->  ANTONY. Well, well- away.
line 8343-->                         Exeunt ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS
line 8344-->  SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.
line 8345-->  CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
line 8346-->    Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,
line 8347-->    And we are women's men.
line 8348-->  SOLDIER. You keep by land
line 8349-->    The legions and the horse whole, do you not?  
line 8350-->  CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
line 8351-->    Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;
line 8352-->    But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
line 8353-->    Carries beyond belief.
line 8354-->  SOLDIER. While he was yet in Rome,
line 8355-->    His power went out in such distractions as
line 8356-->    Beguil'd all spies.
line 8357-->  CANIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
line 8358-->  SOLDIER. They say one Taurus.
line 8359-->  CANIDIUS. Well I know the man.
line 8360-->
line 8361-->                        Enter a MESSENGER
line 8362-->
line 8363-->  MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.
line 8364-->  CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth
line 8365-->    Each minute some.                                     Exeunt

line 8369-->                      A plain near Actium
line 8370-->
line 8371-->             Enter CAESAR, with his army, marching
line 8372-->
line 8373-->  CAESAR. Taurus!
line 8374-->  TAURUS. My lord?
line 8375-->  CAESAR. Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle
line 8376-->    Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
line 8377-->    The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies
line 8378-->    Upon this jump.                                       Exeunt

line 8383-->
line 8384-->                  Enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS
line 8385-->
line 8386-->  ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
line 8387-->    In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
line 8388-->    We may the number of the ships behold,
line 8389-->    And so proceed accordingly.                           Exeunt
line 8390-->
line 8391-->ACT_3|SC_10

line 8393-->                 Another part of the plain
line 8394-->
line 8395-->        CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way
line 8396-->        over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of
line 8397-->      CAESAR, the other way. After their going in is heard
line 8398-->                   the noise of a sea-fight
line 8399-->
line 8400-->                    Alarum. Enter ENOBARBUS
line 8401-->
line 8402-->  ENOBARBUS. Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
line 8403-->    Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
line 8404-->    With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.
line 8405-->    To see't mine eyes are blasted.
line 8406-->
line 8407-->                        Enter SCARUS
line 8408-->
line 8409-->  SCARUS. Gods and goddesses,
line 8410-->    All the whole synod of them!
line 8411-->  ENOBARBUS. What's thy passion?
line 8412-->  SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost
line 8413-->    With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away  
line 8414-->    Kingdoms and provinces.
line 8415-->  ENOBARBUS. How appears the fight?
line 8416-->  SCARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence,
line 8417-->    Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-
line 8418-->    Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,
line 8419-->    When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
line 8420-->    Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-
line 8421-->    The breese upon her, like a cow in June-
line 8422-->    Hoists sails and flies.
line 8423-->  ENOBARBUS. That I beheld;
line 8424-->    Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
line 8425-->    Endure a further view.
line 8426-->  SCARUS. She once being loof'd,
line 8427-->    The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
line 8428-->    Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
line 8429-->    Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
line 8430-->    I never saw an action of such shame;
line 8431-->    Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
line 8432-->    Did violate so itself.
line 8433-->  ENOBARBUS. Alack, alack!  
line 8434-->
line 8435-->                       Enter CANIDIUS
line 8436-->
line 8437-->  CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
line 8438-->    And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
line 8439-->    Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
line 8440-->    O, he has given example for our flight
line 8441-->    Most grossly by his own!
line 8442-->  ENOBARBUS. Ay, are you thereabouts?
line 8443-->    Why then, good night indeed.
line 8444-->  CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
line 8445-->  SCARUS. 'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
line 8446-->    What further comes.
line 8447-->  CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I render
line 8448-->    My legions and my horse; six kings already
line 8449-->    Show me the way of yielding.
line 8450-->  ENOBARBUS. I'll yet follow
line 8451-->    The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
line 8452-->    Sits in the wind against me.                          Exeunt

line 8456-->              Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
line 8457-->
line 8458-->               Enter ANTONY With attendants
line 8459-->
line 8460-->  ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
line 8461-->    It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.
line 8462-->    I am so lated in the world that I
line 8463-->    Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship
line 8464-->    Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly,
line 8465-->    And make your peace with Caesar.
line 8466-->  ALL. Fly? Not we!
line 8467-->  ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
line 8468-->    To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
line 8469-->    I have myself resolv'd upon a course
line 8470-->    Which has no need of you; be gone.
line 8471-->    My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
line 8472-->    I follow'd that I blush to look upon.
line 8473-->    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
line 8474-->    Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
line 8475-->    For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall
line 8476-->    Have letters from me to some friends that will  
line 8477-->    Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
line 8478-->    Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
line 8479-->    Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
line 8480-->    Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.
line 8481-->    I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
line 8482-->    Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;
line 8483-->    Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command;
line 8484-->    Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.    [Sits down]
line 8485-->
line 8486-->            Enter CLEOPATRA, led by CHARMIAN and IRAS,
line 8487-->                         EROS following
line 8488-->
line 8489-->  EROS. Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.
line 8490-->  IRAS. Do, most dear Queen.
line 8491-->  CHARMIAN. Do? Why, what else?
line 8492-->  CLEOPATRA. Let me sit down. O Juno!
line 8493-->  ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.
line 8494-->  EROS. See you here, sir?
line 8495-->  ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!
line 8496-->  CHARMIAN. Madam!  
line 8497-->  IRAS. Madam, O good Empress!
line 8498-->  EROS. Sir, sir!
line 8499-->  ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
line 8500-->    His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck
line 8501-->    The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
line 8502-->    That the mad Brutus ended; he alone
line 8503-->    Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had
line 8504-->    In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no matter.
line 8505-->  CLEOPATRA. Ah, stand by!
line 8506-->  EROS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen!
line 8507-->  IRAS. Go to him, madam, speak to him.
line 8508-->    He is unqualitied with very shame.
line 8509-->  CLEOPATRA. Well then, sustain me. O!
line 8510--> EROS. Most noble sir, arise; the Queen approaches.
line 8511-->    Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her but
line 8512-->    Your comfort makes the rescue.
line 8513-->  ANTONY. I have offended reputation-
line 8514-->    A most unnoble swerving.
line 8515-->  EROS. Sir, the Queen.
line 8516-->  ANTONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
line 8517-->    How I convey my shame out of thine eyes  
line 8518-->    By looking back what I have left behind
line 8519-->    'Stroy'd in dishonour.
line 8520-->  CLEOPATRA. O my lord, my lord,
line 8521-->    Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
line 8522-->    You would have followed.
line 8523-->  ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew'st too well
line 8524-->    My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings,
line 8525-->    And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit
line 8526-->    Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
line 8527-->    Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
line 8528-->    Command me.
line 8529-->  CLEOPATRA. O, my pardon!
line 8530-->  ANTONY. Now I must
line 8531-->    To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
line 8532-->    And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
line 8533-->    With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd,
line 8534-->    Making and marring fortunes. You did know
line 8535-->    How much you were my conqueror, and that
line 8536-->    My sword, made weak by my affection, would
line 8537-->    Obey it on all cause.  
line 8538-->  CLEOPATRA. Pardon, pardon!
line 8539-->  ANTONY. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
line 8540-->    All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;
line 8541-->    Even this repays me.
line 8542-->    We sent our schoolmaster; is 'a come back?
line 8543-->    Love, I am full of lead. Some wine,
line 8544-->    Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
line 8545-->    We scorn her most when most she offers blows.         Exeunt

line 8549-->                   CAESAR'S camp in Egypt
line 8550-->
line 8551-->   Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others
line 8552-->
line 8553-->  CAESAR. Let him appear that's come from Antony.
line 8554-->    Know you him?
line 8555-->  DOLABELLA. Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
line 8556-->    An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
line 8557-->    He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
line 8558-->    Which had superfluous kings for messengers
line 8559-->    Not many moons gone by.
line 8560-->
line 8561-->            Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambassador from ANTONY
line 8562-->
line 8563-->  CAESAR. Approach, and speak.
line 8564-->  EUPHRONIUS. Such as I am, I come from Antony.
line 8565-->    I was of late as petty to his ends
line 8566-->    As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf
line 8567-->    To his grand sea.
line 8568-->  CAESAR. Be't so. Declare thine office.
line 8569-->  EUPHRONIUS. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and  
line 8570-->    Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,
line 8571-->    He lessens his requests and to thee sues
line 8572-->    To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
line 8573-->    A private man in Athens. This for him.
line 8574-->    Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
line 8575-->    Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
line 8576-->    The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
line 8577-->    Now hazarded to thy grace.
line 8578-->  CAESAR. For Antony,
line 8579-->    I have no ears to his request. The Queen
line 8580-->    Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
line 8581-->    From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
line 8582-->    Or take his life there. This if she perform,
line 8583-->    She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
line 8584-->  EUPHRONIUS. Fortune pursue thee!
line 8585-->  CAESAR. Bring him through the bands.           Exit EUPHRONIUS
line 8586-->    [To THYREUS] To try thy eloquence, now 'tis time. Dispatch;
line 8587-->    From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,
line 8588-->    And in our name, what she requires; add more,
line 8589-->    From thine invention, offers. Women are not  
line 8590-->    In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
line 8591-->    The ne'er-touch'd vestal. Try thy cunning, Thyreus;
line 8592-->    Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
line 8593-->    Will answer as a law.
line 8594-->  THYREUS. Caesar, I go.
line 8595-->  CAESAR. Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
line 8596-->    And what thou think'st his very action speaks
line 8597-->    In every power that moves.
line 8598-->  THYREUS. Caesar, I shall.                               Exeunt

line 8602-->               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
line 8603-->
line 8604-->        Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
line 8605-->
line 8606-->  CLEOPATRA. What shall we do, Enobarbus?
line 8607-->  ENOBARBUS. Think, and die.
line 8608-->  CLEOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this?
line 8609-->  ENOBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his will
line 8610-->    Lord of his reason. What though you fled
line 8611-->    From that great face of war, whose several ranges
line 8612-->    Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
line 8613-->    The itch of his affection should not then
line 8614-->    Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,
line 8615-->    When half to half the world oppos'd, he being
line 8616-->    The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less
line 8617-->    Than was his loss, to course your flying flags
line 8618-->    And leave his navy gazing.
line 8619-->  CLEOPATRA. Prithee, peace.
line 8620-->
line 8621-->          Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY
line 8622-->  
line 8623-->  ANTONY. Is that his answer?
line 8624-->  EUPHRONIUS. Ay, my lord.
line 8625-->  ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she
line 8626-->    Will yield us up.
line 8627-->  EUPHRONIUS. He says so.
line 8628-->  ANTONY. Let her know't.
line 8629-->    To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
line 8630-->    And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
line 8631-->    With principalities.
line 8632-->  CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord?
line 8633-->  ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose
line 8634-->    Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
line 8635-->    Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,
line 8636-->    May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail
line 8637-->    Under the service of a child as soon
line 8638-->    As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore
line 8639-->    To lay his gay comparisons apart,
line 8640-->    And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
line 8641-->    Ourselves alone. I'll write it. Follow me.
line 8642-->                                    Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS  
line 8643-->  EUPHRONIUS. [Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will
line 8644-->    Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show
line 8645-->    Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
line 8646-->    A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
line 8647-->    Do draw the inward quality after them,
line 8648-->    To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
line 8649-->    Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
line 8650-->    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
line 8651-->    His judgment too.
line 8652-->
line 8653-->                       Enter a SERVANT
line 8654-->
line 8655-->  SERVANT. A messenger from Caesar.
line 8656-->  CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
line 8657-->    Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
line 8658-->    That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.     Exit SERVANT
line 8659-->  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
line 8660-->    The loyalty well held to fools does make
line 8661-->    Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure
line 8662-->    To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord  
line 8663-->    Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
line 8664-->    And earns a place i' th' story.
line 8665-->
line 8666-->                       Enter THYREUS
line 8667-->
line 8668-->  CLEOPATRA. Caesar's will?
line 8669-->  THYREUS. Hear it apart.
line 8670-->  CLEOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly.
line 8671-->  THYREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
line 8672-->  ENOBARBUS. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
line 8673-->    Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
line 8674-->    Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know
line 8675-->    Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.
line 8676-->  THYREUS. So.
line 8677-->    Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats
line 8678-->    Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
line 8679-->    Further than he is Caesar.
line 8680-->  CLEOPATRA. Go on. Right royal!
line 8681-->  THYREUS. He knows that you embrace not Antony
line 8682-->    As you did love, but as you fear'd him.  
line 8683-->  CLEOPATRA. O!
line 8684-->  THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
line 8685-->    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
line 8686-->    Not as deserv'd.
line 8687-->  CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and knows
line 8688-->    What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,
line 8689-->    But conquer'd merely.
line 8690-->  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] To be sure of that,
line 8691-->    I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
line 8692-->    That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
line 8693-->    Thy dearest quit thee.                                  Exit
line 8694-->  THYREUS. Shall I say to Caesar
line 8695-->    What you require of him? For he partly begs
line 8696-->    To be desir'd to give. It much would please him
line 8697-->    That of his fortunes you should make a staff
line 8698-->    To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
line 8699-->    To hear from me you had left Antony,
line 8700-->    And put yourself under his shroud,
line 8701-->    The universal landlord.
line 8702-->  CLEOPATRA. What's your name?  
line 8703-->  THYREUS. My name is Thyreus.
line 8704-->  CLEOPATRA. Most kind messenger,
line 8705-->    Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
line 8706-->    I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt
line 8707-->    To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.
line 8708-->    Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
line 8709-->    The doom of Egypt.
line 8710-->  THYREUS. 'Tis your noblest course.
line 8711-->    Wisdom and fortune combating together,
line 8712-->    If that the former dare but what it can,
line 8713-->    No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
line 8714-->    My duty on your hand.
line 8715-->  CLEOPATRA. Your Caesar's father oft,
line 8716-->    When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
line 8717-->    Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
line 8718-->    As it rain'd kisses.
line 8719-->
line 8720-->                Re-enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS
line 8721-->
line 8722-->  ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that thunders!  
line 8723-->    What art thou, fellow?
line 8724-->  THYREUS. One that but performs
line 8725-->    The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
line 8726-->    To have command obey'd.
line 8727-->  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] You will be whipt.
line 8728-->  ANTONY. Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!
line 8729-->    Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
line 8730-->    Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth
line 8731-->    And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
line 8732-->    Antony yet.
line 8733-->
line 8734-->                       Enter servants
line 8735-->
line 8736-->    Take hence this Jack and whip him.
line 8737-->  ENOBARBUS. 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
line 8738-->    Than with an old one dying.
line 8739-->  ANTONY. Moon and stars!
line 8740-->    Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
line 8741-->    That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
line 8742-->    So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name  
line 8743-->    Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
line 8744-->    Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,
line 8745-->    And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.
line 8746-->  THYMUS. Mark Antony-
line 8747-->  ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt,
line 8748-->    Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall
line 8749-->    Bear us an errand to him.       Exeunt servants with THYREUS
line 8750-->    You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!
line 8751-->    Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
line 8752-->    Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
line 8753-->    And by a gem of women, to be abus'd
line 8754-->    By one that looks on feeders?
line 8755-->  CLEOPATRA. Good my lord-
line 8756-->  ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever.
line 8757-->    But when we in our viciousness grow hard-
line 8758-->    O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes,
line 8759-->    In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us
line 8760-->    Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut
line 8761-->    To our confusion.
line 8762-->  CLEOPATRA. O, is't come to this?  
line 8763-->  ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon
line 8764-->    Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment
line 8765-->    Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,
line 8766-->    Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have
line 8767-->    Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure,
line 8768-->    Though you can guess what temperance should be,
line 8769-->    You know not what it is.
line 8770-->  CLEOPATRA. Wherefore is this?
line 8771-->  ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
line 8772-->    And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
line 8773-->    My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
line 8774-->    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
line 8775-->    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
line 8776-->    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
line 8777-->    And to proclaim it civilly were like
line 8778-->    A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
line 8779-->    For being yare about him.
line 8780-->
line 8781-->              Re-enter a SERVANT with THYREUS
line 8782-->  
line 8783-->    Is he whipt?
line 8784-->  SERVANT. Soundly, my lord.
line 8785-->  ANTONY. Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?
line 8786-->  SERVANT. He did ask favour.
line 8787-->  ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
line 8788-->    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
line 8789-->    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
line 8790-->    Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
line 8791-->    The white hand of a lady fever thee!
line 8792-->    Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
line 8793-->    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
line 8794-->    He makes me angry with him; for he seems
line 8795-->    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
line 8796-->    Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
line 8797-->    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
line 8798-->    When my good stars, that were my former guides,
line 8799-->    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
line 8800-->    Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
line 8801-->    My speech and what is done, tell him he has
line 8802-->    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom  
line 8803-->    He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
line 8804-->    As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
line 8805-->    Hence with thy stripes, be gone.                Exit THYREUS
line 8806-->  CLEOPATRA. Have you done yet?
line 8807-->  ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon
line 8808-->    Is now eclips'd, and it portends alone
line 8809-->    The fall of Antony.
line 8810-->  CLEOPATRA. I must stay his time.
line 8811-->  ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
line 8812-->    With one that ties his points?
line 8813-->  CLEOPATRA. Not know me yet?
line 8814-->  ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?
line 8815-->  CLEOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so,
line 8816-->    From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
line 8817-->    And poison it in the source, and the first stone
line 8818-->    Drop in my neck; as it determines, so
line 8819-->    Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
line 8820-->    Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
line 8821-->    Together with my brave Egyptians all,
line 8822-->    By the discandying of this pelleted storm,  
line 8823-->    Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
line 8824-->    Have buried them for prey.
line 8825-->  ANTONY. I am satisfied.
line 8826-->    Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
line 8827-->    I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
line 8828-->    Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to
line 8829-->    Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
line 8830-->    Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
line 8831-->    If from the field I shall return once more
line 8832-->    To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.
line 8833-->    I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
line 8834-->    There's hope in't yet.
line 8835-->  CLEOPATRA. That's my brave lord!
line 8836-->  ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
line 8837-->    And fight maliciously. For when mine hours
line 8838-->    Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
line 8839-->    Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
line 8840-->    And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
line 8841-->    Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me
line 8842-->    All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;  
line 8843-->    Let's mock the midnight bell.
line 8844-->  CLEOPATRA. It is my birthday.
line 8845-->    I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord
line 8846-->    Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
line 8847-->  ANTONY. We will yet do well.
line 8848-->  CLEOPATRA. Call all his noble captains to my lord.
line 8849-->  ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
line 8850-->    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
line 8851-->    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
line 8852-->    I'll make death love me; for I will contend
line 8853-->    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
line 8854-->  ENOBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
line 8855-->    Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
line 8856-->    The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
line 8857-->    A diminution in our captain's brain
line 8858-->    Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,
line 8859-->    It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
line 8860-->    Some way to leave him.                                  Exit
line 8861-->

line 8864-->              CAESAR'S camp before Alexandria
line 8865-->
line 8866-->      Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS, with his army;
line 8867-->                 CAESAR reading a letter
line 8868-->
line 8869-->  CAESAR. He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
line 8870-->    To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger
line 8871-->    He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat,
line 8872-->    Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
line 8873-->    I have many other ways to die, meantime
line 8874-->    Laugh at his challenge.
line 8875-->  MAECENAS. Caesar must think
line 8876-->    When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
line 8877-->    Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
line 8878-->    Make boot of his distraction. Never anger
line 8879-->    Made good guard for itself.
line 8880-->  CAESAR. Let our best heads
line 8881-->    Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
line 8882-->    We mean to fight. Within our files there are
line 8883-->    Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late
line 8884-->    Enough to fetch him in. See it done;  
line 8885-->    And feast the army; we have store to do't,
line 8886-->    And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!          Exeunt
line 8887-->
line 8888-->ACT_4|SC_2
line 8889-->                          SCENE II.
line 8890-->               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace
line 8891-->
line 8892-->      Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS,
line 8893-->                     ALEXAS, with others
line 8894-->
line 8895-->  ANTONY. He will not fight with me, Domitius?
line 8896-->  ENOBARBUS. No.
line 8897-->  ANTONY. Why should he not?
line 8898-->  ENOBARBUS. He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
line 8899-->    He is twenty men to one.
line 8900-->  ANTONY. To-morrow, soldier,
line 8901-->    By sea and land I'll fight. Or I will live,
line 8902-->    Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
line 8903-->    Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
line 8904-->  ENOBARBUS. I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
line 8905-->  ANTONY. Well said; come on.
line 8906-->    Call forth my household servants; let's to-night
line 8907-->    Be bounteous at our meal.
line 8908-->
line 8909-->                Enter three or four servitors
line 8910-->  
line 8911-->    Give me thy hand,
line 8912-->    Thou has been rightly honest. So hast thou;
line 8913-->    Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv'd me well,
line 8914-->    And kings have been your fellows.
line 8915-->  CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this?
line 8916-->  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd tricks which
line 8917-->      sorrow shoots
line 8918-->    Out of the mind.
line 8919-->  ANTONY. And thou art honest too.
line 8920-->    I wish I could be made so many men,
line 8921-->    And all of you clapp'd up together in
line 8922-->    An Antony, that I might do you service
line 8923-->    So good as you have done.
line 8924-->  SERVANT. The gods forbid!
line 8925-->  ANTONY. Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.
line 8926-->    Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
line 8927-->    As when mine empire was your fellow too,
line 8928-->    And suffer'd my command.
line 8929-->  CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?
line 8930-->    ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.  
line 8931-->  ANTONY. Tend me to-night;
line 8932-->    May be it is the period of your duty.
line 8933-->    Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
line 8934-->    A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
line 8935-->    You'll serve another master. I look on you
line 8936-->    As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
line 8937-->    I turn you not away; but, like a master
line 8938-->    Married to your good service, stay till death.
line 8939-->    Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
line 8940-->    And the gods yield you for't!
line 8941-->  ENOBARBUS. What mean you, sir,
line 8942-->    To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
line 8943-->    And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd. For shame!
line 8944-->    Transform us not to women.
line 8945-->  ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho!
line 8946-->    Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
line 8947-->    Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
line 8948-->    You take me in too dolorous a sense;
line 8949-->    For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
line 8950-->    To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,  
line 8951-->    I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you
line 8952-->    Where rather I'll expect victorious life
line 8953-->    Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
line 8954-->    And drown consideration.                              Exeunt

line 8959-->
line 8960-->                 Enter a company of soldiers
line 8961-->
line 8962-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day.
line 8963-->  SECOND SOLDIER. It will determine one way. Fare you well.
line 8964-->    Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
line 8965-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Nothing. What news?
line 8966-->  SECOND SOLDIER. Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
line 8967-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, sir, good night.
line 8968-->                                      [They meet other soldiers]
line 8969-->  SECOND SOLDIER. Soldiers, have careful watch.
line 8970-->  FIRST SOLDIER. And you. Good night, good night.
line 8971-->                [The two companies separate and place themselves
line 8972-->                                   in every corner of the stage]
line 8973-->  SECOND SOLDIER. Here we. And if to-morrow
line 8974-->    Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
line 8975-->    Our landmen will stand up.
line 8976-->  THIRD SOLDIER. 'Tis a brave army,
line 8977-->    And full of purpose.
line 8978-->                      [Music of the hautboys is under the stage]  
line 8979-->  SECOND SOLDIER. Peace, what noise?
line 8980-->  THIRD SOLDIER. List, list!
line 8981-->  SECOND SOLDIER. Hark!
line 8982-->  THIRD SOLDIER. Music i' th' air.
line 8983-->  FOURTH SOLDIER. Under the earth.
line 8984-->  THIRD SOLDIER. It signs well, does it not?
line 8985-->  FOURTH SOLDIER. No.
line 8986-->  THIRD SOLDIER. Peace, I say!
line 8987-->    What should this mean?
line 8988-->  SECOND SOLDIER. 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,
line 8989-->    Now leaves him.
line 8990-->  THIRD SOLDIER. Walk; let's see if other watchmen
line 8991-->    Do hear what we do.
line 8992-->  SECOND SOLDIER. How now, masters!
line 8993-->  SOLDIERS. [Speaking together] How now!
line 8994-->    How now! Do you hear this?
line 8995-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Ay; is't not strange?
line 8996-->  THIRD SOLDIER. Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?
line 8997-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
line 8998-->    Let's see how it will give off.  
line 8999-->  SOLDIERS. Content. 'Tis strange.                        Exeunt

line 9016-->    Because we brave her. Come.
line 9017-->  CLEOPATRA. Nay, I'll help too.
line 9018-->    What's this for?
line 9019-->  ANTONY. Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
line 9020-->    The armourer of my heart. False, false; this, this.
line 9021-->  CLEOPATRA. Sooth, la, I'll help. Thus it must be.
line 9022-->  ANTONY. Well, well;
line 9023-->    We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?  
line 9024-->    Go put on thy defences.
line 9025-->  EROS. Briefly, sir.
line 9026-->  CLEOPATRA. Is not this buckled well?
line 9027-->  ANTONY. Rarely, rarely!
line 9028-->    He that unbuckles this, till we do please
line 9029-->    To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
line 9030-->    Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire
line 9031-->    More tight at this than thou. Dispatch. O love,
line 9032-->    That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
line 9033-->    The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see
line 9034-->    A workman in't.
line 9035-->
line 9036-->                   Enter an armed SOLDIER
line 9037-->
line 9038-->    Good-morrow to thee. Welcome.
line 9039-->    Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge.
line 9040-->    To business that we love we rise betime,
line 9041-->    And go to't with delight.
line 9042-->  SOLDIER. A thousand, sir,
line 9043-->    Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,  
line 9044-->    And at the port expect you.
line 9045-->                            [Shout. Flourish of trumpets within]

line 9048-->
line 9049-->  CAPTAIN. The morn is fair. Good morrow, General.
line 9050-->  ALL. Good morrow, General.
line 9051-->  ANTONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.
line 9052-->    This morning, like the spirit of a youth
line 9053-->    That means to be of note, begins betimes.
line 9054-->    So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
line 9055-->    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
line 9056-->    This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,
line 9057-->    And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
line 9058-->    On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
line 9059-->    Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,
line 9060-->    Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.
line 9061-->                      Exeunt ANTONY, EROS, CAPTAINS and soldiers
line 9062-->  CHARMIAN. Please you retire to your chamber?
line 9063-->  CLEOPATRA. Lead me.
line 9064-->    He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
line 9065-->    Determine this great war in single fight!
line 9066-->    Then, Antony- but now. Well, on.                      Exeunt

line 9073-->                       meeting them
line 9074-->
line 9075-->  SOLDIER. The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
line 9076-->  ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
line 9077-->    To make me fight at land!
line 9078-->  SOLDIER. Hadst thou done so,
line 9079-->    The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
line 9080-->    That has this morning left thee, would have still
line 9081-->    Followed thy heels.
line 9082-->  ANTONY. Who's gone this morning?
line 9083-->  SOLDIER. Who?
line 9084-->    One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,
line 9085-->    He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
line 9086-->    Say 'I am none of thine.'
line 9087-->  ANTONY. What say'st thou?
line 9088-->  SOLDIER. Sir,
line 9089-->    He is with Caesar.
line 9090-->  EROS. Sir, his chests and treasure  
line 9091-->    He has not with him.
line 9092-->  ANTONY. Is he gone?
line 9093-->  SOLDIER. Most certain.
line 9094-->  ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
line 9095-->    Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him-
line 9096-->    I will subscribe- gentle adieus and greetings;
line 9097-->    Say that I wish he never find more cause
line 9098-->    To change a master. O, my fortunes have
line 9099-->    Corrupted honest men! Dispatch. Enobarbus!            Exeunt

line 9106-->                       and ENOBARBUS
line 9107-->
line 9108-->  CAESAR. Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
line 9109-->    Our will is Antony be took alive;
line 9110-->    Make it so known.
line 9111-->  AGRIPPA. Caesar, I shall.                                 Exit
line 9112-->  CAESAR. The time of universal peace is near.
line 9113-->    Prove this a prosp'rous day, the three-nook'd world
line 9114-->    Shall bear the olive freely.

line 9117-->
line 9118-->  MESSENGER. Antony
line 9119-->    Is come into the field.
line 9120-->  CAESAR. Go charge Agrippa
line 9121-->    Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
line 9122-->    That Antony may seem to spend his fury
line 9123-->    Upon himself.                       Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS  
line 9124-->  ENOBARBUS. Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
line 9125-->    Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
line 9126-->    Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
line 9127-->    And leave his master Antony. For this pains
line 9128-->    Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
line 9129-->    That fell away have entertainment, but
line 9130-->    No honourable trust. I have done ill,
line 9131-->    Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
line 9132-->    That I will joy no more.
line 9133-->
line 9134-->                  Enter a SOLDIER of CAESAR'S
line 9135-->
line 9136-->  SOLDIER. Enobarbus, Antony
line 9137-->    Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
line 9138-->    His bounty overplus. The messenger
line 9139-->    Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
line 9140-->    Unloading of his mules.
line 9141-->  ENOBARBUS. I give it you.
line 9142-->  SOLDIER. Mock not, Enobarbus.
line 9143-->    I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer  
line 9144-->    Out of the host. I must attend mine office,
line 9145-->    Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
line 9146-->    Continues still a Jove.                                 Exit
line 9147-->  ENOBARBUS. I am alone the villain of the earth,
line 9148-->    And feel I am so most. O Antony,
line 9149-->    Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
line 9150-->    My better service, when my turpitude
line 9151-->    Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.
line 9152-->    If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
line 9153-->    Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel.
line 9154-->    I fight against thee? No! I will go seek
line 9155-->    Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
line 9156-->    My latter part of life.                                 Exit

line 9163-->                        and others
line 9164-->
line 9165-->  AGRIPPA. Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.
line 9166-->    Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
line 9167-->    Exceeds what we expected.                             Exeunt
line 9168-->
line 9169-->          Alarums. Enter ANTONY, and SCARUS wounded
line 9170-->
line 9171-->  SCARUS. O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
line 9172-->    Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
line 9173-->    With clouts about their heads.
line 9174-->  ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
line 9175-->  SCARUS. I had a wound here that was like a T,
line 9176-->    But now 'tis made an H.
line 9177-->  ANTONY. They do retire.
line 9178-->  SCARUS. We'll beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet
line 9179-->    Room for six scotches more.
line 9180-->  
line 9181-->                        Enter EROS
line 9182-->
line 9183-->  EROS. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
line 9184-->    For a fair victory.
line 9185-->  SCARUS. Let us score their backs
line 9186-->    And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.
line 9187-->    'Tis sport to maul a runner.
line 9188-->  ANTONY. I will reward thee
line 9189-->    Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
line 9190-->    For thy good valour. Come thee on.
line 9191-->    SCARUS. I'll halt after.                              Exeunt

line 9198-->                        with others
line 9199-->
line 9200-->  ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
line 9201-->    And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
line 9202-->    Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood
line 9203-->    That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;
line 9204-->    For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
line 9205-->    Not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been
line 9206-->    Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
line 9207-->    Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
line 9208-->    Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
line 9209-->    Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss
line 9210-->    The honour'd gashes whole.
line 9211-->
line 9212-->                 Enter CLEOPATRA, attended
line 9213-->
line 9214-->    [To SCARUS] Give me thy hand-
line 9215-->    To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,  
line 9216-->    Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o' th' world,
line 9217-->    Chain mine arm'd neck. Leap thou, attire and all,
line 9218-->    Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
line 9219-->    Ride on the pants triumphing.
line 9220-->  CLEOPATRA. Lord of lords!
line 9221-->    O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
line 9222-->    The world's great snare uncaught?
line 9223-->  ANTONY. Mine nightingale,
line 9224-->    We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey
line 9225-->    Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
line 9226-->    A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
line 9227-->    Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
line 9228-->    Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand-
line 9229-->    Kiss it, my warrior- he hath fought to-day
line 9230-->    As if a god in hate of mankind had
line 9231-->    Destroyed in such a shape.
line 9232-->  CLEOPATRA. I'll give thee, friend,
line 9233-->    An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
line 9234-->  ANTONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
line 9235-->    Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand.  
line 9236-->    Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
line 9237-->    Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.
line 9238-->    Had our great palace the capacity
line 9239-->    To camp this host, we all would sup together,
line 9240-->    And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
line 9241-->    Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
line 9242-->    With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
line 9243-->    Make mingle with our rattling tabourines,
line 9244-->    That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
line 9245-->    Applauding our approach.                              Exeunt

line 9252-->
line 9253-->  CENTURION. If we be not reliev'd within this hour,
line 9254-->    We must return to th' court of guard. The night
line 9255-->    Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
line 9256-->    By th' second hour i' th' morn.
line 9257-->  FIRST WATCH. This last day was
line 9258-->    A shrewd one to's.
line 9259-->  ENOBARBUS. O, bear me witness, night-
line 9260-->  SECOND WATCH. What man is this?
line 9261-->  FIRST WATCH. Stand close and list him.
line 9262-->  ENOBARBUS. Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
line 9263-->    When men revolted shall upon record
line 9264-->    Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
line 9265-->    Before thy face repent!
line 9266-->  CENTURION. Enobarbus?
line 9267-->  SECOND WATCH. Peace!
line 9268-->    Hark further.
line 9269-->  ENOBARBUS. O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,  
line 9270-->    The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
line 9271-->    That life, a very rebel to my will,
line 9272-->    May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart
line 9273-->    Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
line 9274-->    Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
line 9275-->    And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
line 9276-->    Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
line 9277-->    Forgive me in thine own particular,
line 9278-->    But let the world rank me in register
line 9279-->    A master-leaver and a fugitive!

line 9281-->  FIRST WATCH. Let's speak to him.
line 9282-->  CENTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
line 9283-->    May concern Caesar.
line 9284-->  SECOND WATCH. Let's do so. But he sleeps.
line 9285-->  CENTURION. Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
line 9286-->    Was never yet for sleep.
line 9287-->  FIRST WATCH. Go we to him.
line 9288-->  SECOND WATCH. Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
line 9289-->  FIRST WATCH. Hear you, sir?  
line 9290-->  CENTURION. The hand of death hath raught him.
line 9291-->    [Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums
line 9292-->    Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
line 9293-->    To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
line 9294-->    Is fully out.
line 9295-->  SECOND WATCH. Come on, then;

line 9306-->  SCARUS. For both, my lord.
line 9307-->  ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
line 9308-->    We'd fight there too. But this it is, our foot
line 9309-->    Upon the hills adjoining to the city
line 9310-->    Shall stay with us- Order for sea is given;
line 9311-->    They have put forth the haven-

line 9319-->                Enter CAESAR and his army
line 9320-->
line 9321-->  CAESAR. But being charg'd, we will be still by land,
line 9322-->    Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
line 9323-->    Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,

line 9332-->  ANTONY. Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
line 9333-->    I shall discover all. I'll bring thee word
line 9334-->    Straight how 'tis like to go.                           Exit
line 9335-->  SCARUS. Swallows have built
line 9336-->    In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
line 9337-->    Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
line 9338-->    And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony

line 9346-->  ANTONY. All is lost!
line 9347-->    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
line 9348-->    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder  
line 9349-->    They cast their caps up and carouse together
line 9350-->    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
line 9351-->    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
line 9352-->    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
line 9353-->    For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
line 9354-->    I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.       Exit SCARUS
line 9355-->    O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more!
line 9356-->    Fortune and Antony part here; even here
line 9357-->    Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
line 9358-->    That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
line 9359-->    Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
line 9360-->    On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd
line 9361-->    That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
line 9362-->    O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm-
line 9363-->    Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home,
line 9364-->    Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end-
line 9365-->    Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose
line 9366-->    Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.

line 9369-->                      Enter CLEOPATRA

line 9371-->    Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
line 9372-->  CLEOPATRA. Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?
line 9373-->  ANTONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
line 9374-->    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
line 9375-->    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;

line 9377-->    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
line 9378-->    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
line 9379-->    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
line 9380-->    With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA
line 9381-->    'Tis well th'art gone,
line 9382-->    If it be well to live; but better 'twere
line 9383-->    Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
line 9384-->    Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
line 9385-->    The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
line 9386-->    Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
line 9387-->    Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon,
line 9388-->    And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
line 9389-->    Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.
line 9390-->    To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
line 9391-->    Under this plot. She dies for't. Eros, ho!              Exit

line 9396-->
line 9397-->      Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
line 9398-->
line 9399-->  CLEOPATRA. Help me, my women. O, he is more mad
line 9400-->    Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
line 9401-->    Was never so emboss'd.
line 9402-->  CHARMIAN. To th'monument!
line 9403-->    There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
line 9404-->    The soul and body rive not more in parting
line 9405-->    Than greatness going off.
line 9406-->  CLEOPATRA. To th' monument!
line 9407-->    Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
line 9408-->    Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony'
line 9409-->    And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
line 9410-->    And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument!
line 9411-->                                                          Exeunt

line 9416-->
line 9417-->                   Enter ANTONY and EROS
line 9418-->
line 9419-->  ANTONY. Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
line 9420-->  EROS. Ay, noble lord.
line 9421-->  ANTONY. Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
line 9422-->    A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
line 9423-->    A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
line 9424-->    A forked mountain, or blue promontory
line 9425-->    With trees upon't that nod unto the world
line 9426-->    And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs;
line 9427-->    They are black vesper's pageants.
line 9428-->  EROS. Ay, my lord.
line 9429-->  ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
line 9430-->    The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
line 9431-->    As water is in water.
line 9432-->  EROS. It does, my lord.
line 9433-->  ANTONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
line 9434-->    Even such a body. Here I am Antony;
line 9435-->    Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.  
line 9436-->    I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
line 9437-->    Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
line 9438-->    Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
line 9439-->    A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
line 9440-->    Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
line 9441-->    Unto an enemy's triumph.
line 9442-->    Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
line 9443-->    Ourselves to end ourselves.
line 9444-->
line 9445-->                         Enter MARDIAN
line 9446-->
line 9447-->    O, thy vile lady!
line 9448-->    She has robb'd me of my sword.
line 9449-->  MARDIAN. No, Antony;
line 9450-->    My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
line 9451-->    With thine entirely.
line 9452-->  ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
line 9453-->    She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death.
line 9454-->  MARDIAN. Death of one person can be paid but once,
line 9455-->    And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do  
line 9456-->    Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake
line 9457-->    Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
line 9458-->    Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
line 9459-->    The name of Antony; it was divided
line 9460-->    Between her heart and lips. She rend'red life,
line 9461-->    Thy name so buried in her.
line 9462-->  ANTONY. Dead then?
line 9463-->  MARDIAN. Dead.
line 9464-->  ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
line 9465-->    And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
line 9466-->    Does pay thy labour richly. Go.                 Exit MARDIAN
line 9467-->    Off, pluck off!
line 9468-->    The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
line 9469-->    The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
line 9470-->    Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
line 9471-->    Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
line 9472-->    No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
line 9473-->    You have been nobly borne.- From me awhile.        Exit EROS
line 9474-->    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
line 9475-->    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now  
line 9476-->    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
line 9477-->    Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
line 9478-->    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
line 9479-->    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
line 9480-->    Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
line 9481-->    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
line 9482-->    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
line 9483-->    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
line 9484-->    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!
line 9485-->
line 9486-->                       Re-enter EROS
line 9487-->
line 9488-->  EROS. What would my lord?
line 9489-->  ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,
line 9490-->    I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods
line 9491-->    Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
line 9492-->    Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
line 9493-->    With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
line 9494-->    The courage of a woman; less noble mind
line 9495-->    Than she which by her death our Caesar tells  
line 9496-->    'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
line 9497-->    That, when the exigent should come- which now
line 9498-->    Is come indeed- when I should see behind me
line 9499-->    Th' inevitable prosecution of
line 9500-->    Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
line 9501-->    Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.
line 9502-->    Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
line 9503-->    Put colour in thy cheek.
line 9504-->  EROS. The gods withhold me!
line 9505-->    Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
line 9506-->    Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
line 9507-->  ANTONY. Eros,
line 9508-->    Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
line 9509-->    Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
line 9510-->    His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
line 9511-->    To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
line 9512-->    Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
line 9513-->    His baseness that ensued?
line 9514-->  EROS. I would not see't.
line 9515-->  ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.  
line 9516-->    Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
line 9517-->    Most useful for thy country.
line 9518-->  EROS. O, sir, pardon me!
line 9519-->  ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
line 9520-->    To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
line 9521-->    Or thy precedent services are all
line 9522-->    But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.
line 9523-->  EROS. Turn from me then that noble countenance,
line 9524-->    Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
line 9525-->  ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
line 9526-->  EROS. My sword is drawn.
line 9527-->  ANTONY. Then let it do at once
line 9528-->    The thing why thou hast drawn it.
line 9529-->  EROS. My dear master,
line 9530-->    My captain and my emperor, let me say,
line 9531-->    Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
line 9532-->  ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
line 9533-->  EROS. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
line 9534-->  ANTONY. Now, Eros.
line 9535-->  EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow  
line 9536-->    Of Antony's death.                            [Kills himself
line 9537-->  ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
line 9538-->    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
line 9539-->    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
line 9540-->    Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
line 9541-->    A nobleness in record. But I will be
line 9542-->    A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
line 9543-->    As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
line 9544-->    Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
line 9545-->                                          [Falling on his sword]
line 9546-->    I learn'd of thee. How? not dead? not dead?-
line 9547-->    The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
line 9548-->
line 9549-->                  Enter DERCETAS and a guard
line 9550-->
line 9551-->  FIRST GUARD. What's the noise?
line 9552-->  ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
line 9553-->    Of what I have begun.
line 9554-->  SECOND GUARD. The star is fall'n.
line 9555-->  FIRST GUARD. And time is at his period.  
line 9556-->  ALL. Alas, and woe!
line 9557-->  ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
line 9558-->  FIRST GUARD. Not I.
line 9559-->  SECOND GUARD. Nor I.
line 9560-->  THIRD GUARD. Nor any one.                         Exeunt guard
line 9561-->  DERCETAS. Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
line 9562-->    This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
line 9563-->    Shall enter me with him.
line 9564-->
line 9565-->                       Enter DIOMEDES
line 9566-->
line 9567-->  DIOMEDES. Where's Antony?
line 9568-->  DERCETAS. There, Diomed, there.
line 9569-->  DIOMEDES. Lives he?
line 9570-->    Wilt thou not answer, man?                     Exit DERCETAS
line 9571-->  ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
line 9572-->    Sufficing strokes for death.
line 9573-->  DIOMEDES. Most absolute lord,
line 9574-->    My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
line 9575-->  ANTONY. When did she send thee?  
line 9576-->  DIOMEDES. Now, my lord.
line 9577-->  ANTONY. Where is she?
line 9578-->  DIOMEDES. Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
line 9579-->    Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-
line 9580-->    Which never shall be found- you did suspect
line 9581-->    She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage
line 9582-->    Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;
line 9583-->    But fearing since how it might work, hath sent
line 9584-->    Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
line 9585-->    I dread, too late.
line 9586-->  ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
line 9587-->  DIOMEDES. What, ho! the Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho!
line 9588-->    Come, your lord calls!
line 9589-->
line 9590-->             Enter four or five of the guard of ANTONY
line 9591-->
line 9592-->  ANTONY. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
line 9593-->    'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
line 9594-->  FIRST GUARD. Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
line 9595-->    All your true followers out.  
line 9596-->  ALL. Most heavy day!
line 9597-->  ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
line 9598-->    To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome
line 9599-->    Which comes to punish us, and we punish it,
line 9600-->    Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up.
line 9601-->    I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends,
line 9602-->    And have my thanks for all.           Exeunt, hearing ANTONY
line 9603-->ACT_4|SC_15
line 9604-->                         SCENE XV.
line 9605-->                   Alexandria. A monument
line 9606-->
line 9607-->      Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN
line 9608-->                         and IRAS
line 9609-->
line 9610-->  CLEOPATRA. O Charmian, I will never go from hence!
line 9611-->  CHARMIAN. Be comforted, dear madam.
line 9612-->  CLEOPATRA. No, I will not.
line 9613-->    All strange and terrible events are welcome,
line 9614-->    But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
line 9615-->    Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
line 9616-->    As that which makes it.
line 9617-->
line 9618-->                   Enter DIOMEDES, below
line 9619-->
line 9620-->    How now! Is he dead?
line 9621-->  DIOMEDES. His death's upon him, but not dead.
line 9622-->    Look out o' th' other side your monument;
line 9623-->    His guard have brought him thither.
line 9624-->
line 9625-->            Enter, below, ANTONY, borne by the guard  
line 9626-->
line 9627-->  CLEOPATRA. O sun,
line 9628-->    Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling stand
line 9629-->    The varying shore o' th' world. O Antony,
line 9630-->    Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;
line 9631-->    Help, friends below! Let's draw him hither.
line 9632-->  ANTONY. Peace!
line 9633-->    Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
line 9634-->    But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
line 9635-->  CLEOPATRA. So it should be, that none but Antony
line 9636-->    Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
line 9637-->  ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
line 9638-->    I here importune death awhile, until
line 9639-->    Of many thousand kisses the poor last
line 9640-->    I lay upon thy lips.
line 9641-->  CLEOPATRA. I dare not, dear.
line 9642-->    Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not,
line 9643-->    Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show
line 9644-->    Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever shall
line 9645-->    Be brooch'd with me. If knife, drugs, serpents, have  
line 9646-->    Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
line 9647-->    Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
line 9648-->    And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
line 9649-->    Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony-
line 9650-->    Help me, my women- we must draw thee up;
line 9651-->    Assist, good friends.
line 9652-->  ANTONY. O, quick, or I am gone.
line 9653-->  CLEOPATRA. Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
line 9654-->    Our strength is all gone into heaviness;
line 9655-->    That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,
line 9656-->    The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
line 9657-->    And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little.
line 9658-->    Wishers were ever fools. O come, come,
line 9659-->                          [They heave ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA]
line 9660-->    And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast liv'd.
line 9661-->    Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,
line 9662-->    Thus would I wear them out.
line 9663-->  ALL. A heavy sight!
line 9664-->  ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying.
line 9665-->    Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.  
line 9666-->  CLEOPATRA. No, let me speak; and let me rail so high
line 9667-->    That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,
line 9668-->    Provok'd by my offence.
line 9669-->  ANTONY. One word, sweet queen:
line 9670-->    Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!
line 9671-->  CLEOPATRA. They do not go together.
line 9672-->  ANTONY. Gentle, hear me:
line 9673-->    None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
line 9674-->  CLEOPATRA. My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
line 9675-->    None about Caesar
line 9676-->  ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end
line 9677-->    Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
line 9678-->    In feeding them with those my former fortunes
line 9679-->    Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world,
line 9680-->    The noblest; and do now not basely die,
line 9681-->    Not cowardly put off my helmet to
line 9682-->    My countryman- a Roman by a Roman
line 9683-->    Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going
line 9684-->    I can no more.
line 9685-->  CLEOPATRA. Noblest of men, woo't die?  
line 9686-->    Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
line 9687-->    In this dull world, which in thy absence is
line 9688-->    No better than a sty? O, see, my women,        [Antony dies]
line 9689-->    The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord!
line 9690-->    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
line 9691-->    The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls
line 9692-->    Are level now with men. The odds is gone,
line 9693-->    And there is nothing left remarkable
line 9694-->    Beneath the visiting moon.                          [Swoons]
line 9695-->  CHARMIAN. O, quietness, lady!
line 9696-->  IRAS. She's dead too, our sovereign.
line 9697-->  CHARMIAN. Lady!
line 9698-->  IRAS. Madam!
line 9699-->  CHARMIAN. O madam, madam, madam!
line 9700-->  IRAS. Royal Egypt, Empress!
line 9701-->  CHARMIAN. Peace, peace, Iras!
line 9702-->  CLEOPATRA. No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
line 9703-->    By such poor passion as the maid that milks
line 9704-->    And does the meanest chares. It were for me
line 9705-->    To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;  
line 9706-->    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
line 9707-->    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
line 9708-->    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
line 9709-->    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
line 9710-->    To rush into the secret house of death
line 9711-->    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
line 9712-->    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
line 9713-->    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
line 9714-->    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
line 9715-->    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
line 9716-->    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
line 9717-->    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
line 9718-->    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
line 9719-->    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
line 9720-->    But resolution and the briefest end.
line 9721-->                   Exeunt; those above hearing off ANTONY'S body

line 9735-->             Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY
line 9736-->
line 9737-->  CAESAR. Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
line 9738-->    Appear thus to us?
line 9739-->  DERCETAS. I am call'd Dercetas;
line 9740-->    Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
line 9741-->    Best to be serv'd. Whilst he stood up and spoke,
line 9742-->    He was my master, and I wore my life
line 9743-->    To spend upon his haters. If thou please
line 9744-->    To take me to thee, as I was to him
line 9745-->    I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,  
line 9746-->    I yield thee up my life.
line 9747-->  CAESAR. What is't thou say'st?
line 9748-->  DERCETAS. I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
line 9749-->  CAESAR. The breaking of so great a thing should make
line 9750-->    A greater crack. The round world
line 9751-->    Should have shook lions into civil streets,
line 9752-->    And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
line 9753-->    Is not a single doom; in the name lay
line 9754-->    A moiety of the world.
line 9755-->  DERCETAS. He is dead, Caesar,
line 9756-->    Not by a public minister of justice,
line 9757-->    Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand
line 9758-->    Which writ his honour in the acts it did
line 9759-->    Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
line 9760-->    Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
line 9761-->    I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
line 9762-->    With his most noble blood.
line 9763-->  CAESAR. Look you sad, friends?
line 9764-->    The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
line 9765-->    To wash the eyes of kings.  
line 9766-->  AGRIPPA. And strange it is
line 9767-->    That nature must compel us to lament
line 9768-->    Our most persisted deeds.
line 9769-->  MAECENAS. His taints and honours
line 9770-->    Wag'd equal with him.
line 9771-->  AGRIPPA. A rarer spirit never
line 9772-->    Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us
line 9773-->    Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
line 9774-->  MAECENAS. When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
line 9775-->    He needs must see himself.
line 9776-->  CAESAR. O Antony,
line 9777-->    I have follow'd thee to this! But we do lance
line 9778-->    Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
line 9779-->    Have shown to thee such a declining day
line 9780-->    Or look on thine; we could not stall together
line 9781-->    In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
line 9782-->    With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
line 9783-->    That thou, my brother, my competitor
line 9784-->    In top of all design, my mate in empire,
line 9785-->    Friend and companion in the front of war,  
line 9786-->    The arm of mine own body, and the heart
line 9787-->    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,
line 9788-->    Unreconciliable, should divide
line 9789-->    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-
line 9790-->
line 9791-->                    Enter an EGYPTIAN
line 9792-->
line 9793-->    But I will tell you at some meeter season.
line 9794-->    The business of this man looks out of him;
line 9795-->    We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
line 9796-->  EGYPTIAN. A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress,
line 9797-->    Confin'd in all she has, her monument,
line 9798-->    Of thy intents desires instruction,
line 9799-->    That she preparedly may frame herself
line 9800-->    To th' way she's forc'd to.
line 9801-->  CAESAR. Bid her have good heart.
line 9802-->    She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
line 9803-->    How honourable and how kindly we
line 9804-->    Determine for her; for Caesar cannot learn
line 9805-->    To be ungentle.  
line 9806-->  EGYPTIAN. So the gods preserve thee!                      Exit
line 9807-->  CAESAR. Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say
line 9808-->    We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts
line 9809-->    The quality of her passion shall require,
line 9810-->    Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
line 9811-->    She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
line 9812-->    Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,
line 9813-->    And with your speediest bring us what she says,
line 9814-->    And how you find her.
line 9815-->  PROCULEIUS. Caesar, I shall.                              Exit
line 9816-->  CAESAR. Gallus, go you along.                      Exit GALLUS
line 9817-->    Where's Dolabella, to second Proculeius?
line 9818-->  ALL. Dolabella!
line 9819-->  CAESAR. Let him alone, for I remember now
line 9820-->    How he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready.
line 9821-->    Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
line 9822-->    How hardly I was drawn into this war,
line 9823-->    How calm and gentle I proceeded still
line 9824-->    In all my writings. Go with me, and see
line 9825-->    What I can show in this.                              Exeunt
line 9826-->
line 9827-->ACT_5|SC_2
line 9828-->                         SCENE II.
line 9829-->                Alexandria. The monument
line 9830-->
line 9831-->      Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
line 9832-->
line 9833-->  CLEOPATRA. My desolation does begin to make
line 9834-->    A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
line 9835-->    Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
line 9836-->    A minister of her will; and it is great
line 9837-->    To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
line 9838-->    Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
line 9839-->    Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
line 9840-->    The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
line 9841-->
line 9842-->       Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS,
line 9843-->                          and soldiers
line 9844-->
line 9845-->  PROCULEIUS. Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt,
line 9846-->    And bids thee study on what fair demands
line 9847-->    Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
line 9848-->  CLEOPATRA. What's thy name?
line 9849-->  PROCULEIUS. My name is Proculeius.  
line 9850-->  CLEOPATRA. Antony
line 9851-->    Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
line 9852-->    I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
line 9853-->    That have no use for trusting. If your master
line 9854-->    Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
line 9855-->    That majesty, to keep decorum, must
line 9856-->    No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
line 9857-->    To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
line 9858-->    He gives me so much of mine own as I
line 9859-->    Will kneel to him with thanks.
line 9860-->  PROCULEIUS. Be of good cheer;
line 9861-->    Y'are fall'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.
line 9862-->    Make your full reference freely to my lord,
line 9863-->    Who is so full of grace that it flows over
line 9864-->    On all that need. Let me report to him
line 9865-->    Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
line 9866-->    A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
line 9867-->    Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
line 9868-->  CLEOPATRA. Pray you tell him
line 9869-->    I am his fortune's vassal and I send him  
line 9870-->    The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
line 9871-->    A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
line 9872-->    Look him i' th' face.
line 9873-->  PROCULEIUS. This I'll report, dear lady.
line 9874-->    Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
line 9875-->    Of him that caus'd it.
line 9876-->  GALLUS. You see how easily she may be surpris'd.
line 9877-->
line 9878-->      Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the
line 9879-->       monument by a ladder placed against a window,
line 9880-->       and come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the guard
line 9881-->                unbar and open the gates
line 9882-->
line 9883-->    Guard her till Caesar come.                             Exit
line 9884-->  IRAS. Royal Queen!
line 9885-->  CHARMIAN. O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!
line 9886-->  CLEOPATRA. Quick, quick, good hands.        [Drawing a dagger]
line 9887-->  PROCULEIUS. Hold, worthy lady, hold,             [Disarms her]
line 9888-->    Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
line 9889-->    Reliev'd, but not betray'd.  
line 9890-->  CLEOPATRA. What, of death too,
line 9891-->    That rids our dogs of languish?
line 9892-->  PROCULEIUS. Cleopatra,
line 9893-->    Do not abuse my master's bounty by
line 9894-->    Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see
line 9895-->    His nobleness well acted, which your death
line 9896-->    Will never let come forth.
line 9897-->  CLEOPATRA. Where art thou, death?
line 9898-->    Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen
line 9899-->    Worth many babes and beggars!
line 9900-->  PROCULEIUS. O, temperance, lady!
line 9901-->  CLEOPATRA. Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;
line 9902-->    If idle talk will once be necessary,
line 9903-->    I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
line 9904-->    Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
line 9905-->    Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
line 9906-->    Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
line 9907-->    Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,
line 9908-->    And show me to the shouting varletry
line 9909-->    Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt  
line 9910-->    Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus' mud
line 9911-->    Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies
line 9912-->    Blow me into abhorring! Rather make
line 9913-->    My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
line 9914-->    And hang me up in chains!
line 9915-->  PROCULEIUS. You do extend
line 9916-->    These thoughts of horror further than you shall
line 9917-->    Find cause in Caesar.
line 9918-->
line 9919-->                      Enter DOLABELLA
line 9920-->
line 9921-->  DOLABELLA. Proculeius,
line 9922-->    What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
line 9923-->    And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
line 9924-->    I'll take her to my guard.
line 9925-->  PROCULEIUS. So, Dolabella,
line 9926-->    It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
line 9927-->    [To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
line 9928-->    If you'll employ me to him.
line 9929-->  CLEOPATRA. Say I would die.  
line 9930-->                                  Exeunt PROCULEIUS and soldiers
line 9931-->  DOLABELLA. Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
line 9932-->  CLEOPATRA. I cannot tell.
line 9933-->  DOLABELLA. Assuredly you know me.
line 9934-->  CLEOPATRA. No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
line 9935-->    You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
line 9936-->    Is't not your trick?
line 9937-->  DOLABELLA. I understand not, madam.
line 9938-->  CLEOPATRA. I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony-
line 9939-->    O, such another sleep, that I might see
line 9940-->    But such another man!
line 9941-->  DOLABELLA. If it might please ye-
line 9942-->  CLEOPATRA. His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck
line 9943-->    A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
line 9944-->    The little O, the earth.
line 9945-->  DOLABELLA. Most sovereign creature-
line 9946-->  CLEOPATRA. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
line 9947-->    Crested the world. His voice was propertied
line 9948-->    As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
line 9949-->    But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,  
line 9950-->    He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
line 9951-->    There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
line 9952-->    That grew the more by reaping. His delights
line 9953-->    Were dolphin-like: they show'd his back above
line 9954-->    The element they liv'd in. In his livery
line 9955-->    Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
line 9956-->    As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
line 9957-->  DOLABELLA. Cleopatra-
line 9958-->  CLEOPATRA. Think you there was or might be such a man
line 9959-->    As this I dreamt of?
line 9960-->  DOLABELLA. Gentle madam, no.
line 9961-->  CLEOPATRA. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
line 9962-->    But if there be nor ever were one such,
line 9963-->    It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff
line 9964-->    To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine
line 9965-->    An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
line 9966-->    Condemning shadows quite.
line 9967-->  DOLABELLA. Hear me, good madam.
line 9968-->    Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
line 9969-->    As answering to the weight. Would I might never  
line 9970-->    O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
line 9971-->    By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
line 9972-->    My very heart at root.
line 9973-->  CLEOPATRA. I thank you, sir.
line 9974-->    Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
line 9975-->  DOLABELLA. I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
line 9976-->  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you, sir.
line 9977-->  DOLABELLA. Though he be honourable-
line 9978-->  CLEOPATRA. He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
line 9979-->  DOLABELLA. Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]
line 9980-->                              [Within: 'Make way there-Caesar!']
line 9981-->
line 9982-->       Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,
line 9983-->                     and others of his train
line 9984-->
line 9985-->  CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt?
line 9986-->  DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]
line 9987-->  CAESAR. Arise, you shall not kneel.
line 9988-->    I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
line 9989-->  CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods  
line 9990-->    Will have it thus; my master and my lord
line 9991-->    I must obey.
line 9992-->  CAESAR. Take to you no hard thoughts.
line 9993-->    The record of what injuries you did us,
line 9994-->    Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
line 9995-->    As things but done by chance.
line 9996-->  CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o' th' world,
line 9997-->    I cannot project mine own cause so well
line 9998-->    To make it clear, but do confess I have
line 9999-->    Been laden with like frailties which before
line 10000-->    Have often sham'd our sex.
line 10001-->  CAESAR. Cleopatra, know
line 10002-->    We will extenuate rather than enforce.
line 10003-->    If you apply yourself to our intents-
line 10004-->    Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find
line 10005-->    A benefit in this change; but if you seek
line 10006-->    To lay on me a cruelty by taking
line 10007-->    Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
line 10008-->    Of my good purposes, and put your children
line 10009-->    To that destruction which I'll guard them from,  
line 10010-->    If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
line 10011-->  CLEOPATRA. And may, through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we,
line 10012-->    Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
line 10013-->    Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
line 10014-->  CAESAR. You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
line 10015-->  CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
line 10016-->    I am possess'd of. 'Tis exactly valued,
line 10017-->    Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
line 10018-->  SELEUCUS. Here, madam.
line 10019-->  CLEOPATRA. This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord,
line 10020-->    Upon his peril, that I have reserv'd
line 10021-->    To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
line 10022-->  SELEUCUS. Madam,
line 10023-->    I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
line 10024-->    Speak that which is not.
line 10025-->  CLEOPATRA. What have I kept back?
line 10026-->  SELEUCUS. Enough to purchase what you have made known.
line 10027-->  CAESAR. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
line 10028-->    Your wisdom in the deed.
line 10029-->  CLEOPATRA. See, Caesar! O, behold,  
line 10030-->    How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours;
line 10031-->    And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
line 10032-->    The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
line 10033-->    Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust
line 10034-->    Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt
line 10035-->    Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes
line 10036-->    Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!
line 10037-->    O rarely base!
line 10038-->  CAESAR. Good Queen, let us entreat you.
line 10039-->  CLEOPATRA. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
line 10040-->    That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,
line 10041-->    Doing the honour of thy lordliness
line 10042-->    To one so meek, that mine own servant should
line 10043-->    Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
line 10044-->    Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
line 10045-->    That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
line 10046-->    Immoment toys, things of such dignity
line 10047-->    As we greet modern friends withal; and say
line 10048-->    Some nobler token I have kept apart
line 10049-->    For Livia and Octavia, to induce  
line 10050-->    Their mediation- must I be unfolded
line 10051-->    With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
line 10052-->    Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence;
line 10053-->    Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
line 10054-->    Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
line 10055-->    Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
line 10056-->  CAESAR. Forbear, Seleucus.                       Exit SELEUCUS
line 10057-->  CLEOPATRA. Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
line 10058-->    For things that others do; and when we fall
line 10059-->    We answer others' merits in our name,
line 10060-->    Are therefore to be pitied.
line 10061-->  CAESAR. Cleopatra,
line 10062-->    Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
line 10063-->    Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours,
line 10064-->    Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe
line 10065-->    Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
line 10066-->    Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
line 10067-->    Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Queen;
line 10068-->    For we intend so to dispose you as
line 10069-->    Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.  
line 10070-->    Our care and pity is so much upon you
line 10071-->    That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
line 10072-->  CLEOPATRA. My master and my lord!
line 10073-->  CAESAR. Not so. Adieu.
line 10074-->                           Flourish. Exeunt CAESAR and his train
line 10075-->  CLEOPATRA. He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
line 10076-->    Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian!
line 10077-->                                             [Whispers CHARMIAN]
line 10078-->  IRAS. Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
line 10079-->    And we are for the dark.
line 10080-->  CLEOPATRA. Hie thee again.
line 10081-->    I have spoke already, and it is provided;
line 10082-->    Go put it to the haste.
line 10083-->  CHARMIAN. Madam, I will.
line 10084-->
line 10085-->                      Re-enter DOLABELLA
line 10086-->
line 10087-->  DOLABELLA. Where's the Queen?
line 10088-->  CHARMIAN. Behold, sir.                                    Exit
line 10089-->  CLEOPATRA. Dolabella!  
line 10090-->  DOLABELLA. Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
line 10091-->    Which my love makes religion to obey,
line 10092-->    I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
line 10093-->    Intends his journey, and within three days
line 10094-->    You with your children will he send before.
line 10095-->    Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
line 10096-->    Your pleasure and my promise.
line 10097-->  CLEOPATRA. Dolabella,
line 10098-->    I shall remain your debtor.
line 10099-->  DOLABELLA. I your servant.
line 10100-->    Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.
line 10101-->  CLEOPATRA. Farewell, and thanks.                Exit DOLABELLA
line 10102-->    Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
line 10103-->    Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown
line 10104-->    In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves,
line 10105-->    With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
line 10106-->    Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
line 10107-->    Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
line 10108-->    And forc'd to drink their vapour.
line 10109-->  IRAS. The gods forbid!  
line 10110-->  CLEOPATRA. Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
line 10111-->    Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers
line 10112-->    Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians
line 10113-->    Extemporally will stage us, and present
line 10114-->    Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
line 10115-->    Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
line 10116-->    Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
line 10117-->    I' th' posture of a whore.
line 10118-->  IRAS. O the good gods!
line 10119-->  CLEOPATRA. Nay, that's certain.
line 10120-->  IRAS. I'll never see't, for I am sure mine nails
line 10121-->    Are stronger than mine eyes.
line 10122-->  CLEOPATRA. Why, that's the way
line 10123-->    To fool their preparation and to conquer
line 10124-->    Their most absurd intents.
line 10125-->
line 10126-->                      Enter CHARMIAN
line 10127-->
line 10128-->    Now, Charmian!
line 10129-->    Show me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch  
line 10130-->    My best attires. I am again for Cydnus,
line 10131-->    To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.
line 10132-->    Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
line 10133-->    And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
line 10134-->    To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
line 10135-->                                       Exit IRAS. A noise within
line 10136-->    Wherefore's this noise?
line 10137-->
line 10138-->                     Enter a GUARDSMAN
line 10139-->
line 10140-->  GUARDSMAN. Here is a rural fellow
line 10141-->    That will not be denied your Highness' presence.
line 10142-->    He brings you figs.
line 10143-->  CLEOPATRA. Let him come in.                     Exit GUARDSMAN
line 10144-->    What poor an instrument
line 10145-->    May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.
line 10146-->    My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing
line 10147-->    Of woman in me. Now from head to foot
line 10148-->    I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
line 10149-->    No planet is of mine.  
line 10150-->
line 10151-->          Re-enter GUARDSMAN and CLOWN, with a basket
line 10152-->
line 10153-->  GUARDSMAN. This is the man.
line 10154-->  CLEOPATRA. Avoid, and leave him.                Exit GUARDSMAN
line 10155-->    Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
line 10156-->    That kills and pains not?
line 10157-->  CLOWN. Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should
line 10158-->    desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that
line 10159-->    do die of it do seldom or never recover.
line 10160-->  CLEOPATRA. Remember'st thou any that have died on't?
line 10161-->  CLOWN. Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no
line 10162-->    longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given
line 10163-->    to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how
line 10164-->    she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes
line 10165-->    a very good report o' th' worm. But he that will believe all that
line 10166-->    they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is
line 10167-->    most falliable, the worm's an odd worm.
line 10168-->  CLEOPATRA. Get thee hence; farewell.
line 10169-->  CLOWN. I wish you all joy of the worm.  
line 10170-->                                          [Sets down the basket]
line 10171-->  CLEOPATRA. Farewell.
line 10172-->  CLOWN. You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his
line 10173-->    kind.
line 10174-->  CLEOPATRA. Ay, ay; farewell.
line 10175-->  CLOWN. Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
line 10176-->    of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
line 10177-->  CLEOPATRA. Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
line 10178-->  CLOWN. Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth
line 10179-->    the feeding.
line 10180-->  CLEOPATRA. Will it eat me?
line 10181-->  CLOWN. You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil
line 10182-->    himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for
line 10183-->    the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same
line 10184-->    whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in
line 10185-->    every ten that they make the devils mar five.
line 10186-->  CLEOPATRA. Well, get thee gone; farewell.
line 10187-->  CLOWN. Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o' th' worm.         Exit
line 10188-->
line 10189-->             Re-enter IRAS, with a robe, crown, &c.  
line 10190-->
line 10191-->  CLEOPATRA. Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
line 10192-->    Immortal longings in me. Now no more
line 10193-->    The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
line 10194-->    Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
line 10195-->    Antony call. I see him rouse himself
line 10196-->    To praise my noble act. I hear him mock
line 10197-->    The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
line 10198-->    To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come.
line 10199-->    Now to that name my courage prove my title!
line 10200-->    I am fire and air; my other elements
line 10201-->    I give to baser life. So, have you done?
line 10202-->    Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
line 10203-->    Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.
line 10204-->                              [Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]
line 10205-->    Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
line 10206-->    If thus thou and nature can so gently part,
line 10207-->    The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
line 10208-->    Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
line 10209-->    If thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world  
line 10210-->    It is not worth leave-taking.
line 10211-->  CHARMIAN. Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
line 10212-->    The gods themselves do weep.
line 10213-->  CLEOPATRA. This proves me base.
line 10214-->    If she first meet the curled Antony,
line 10215-->    He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
line 10216-->    Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
line 10217-->                    [To an asp, which she applies to her breast]
line 10218-->    With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
line 10219-->    Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,
line 10220-->    Be angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak,
line 10221-->    That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
line 10222-->    Unpolicied!
line 10223-->  CHARMIAN. O Eastern star!
line 10224-->  CLEOPATRA. Peace, peace!
line 10225-->    Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
line 10226-->    That sucks the nurse asleep?
line 10227-->  CHARMIAN. O, break! O, break!
line 10228-->  CLEOPATRA. As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle-
line 10229-->    O Antony! Nay, I will take thee too:  
line 10230-->                               [Applying another asp to her arm]
line 10231-->    What should I stay-                                   [Dies]
line 10232-->  CHARMIAN. In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
line 10233-->    Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
line 10234-->    A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
line 10235-->    And golden Phoebus never be beheld
line 10236-->    Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
line 10237-->    I'll mend it and then play-
line 10238-->
line 10239-->                  Enter the guard, rushing in
line 10240-->
line 10241-->  FIRST GUARD. Where's the Queen?
line 10242-->  CHARMIAN. Speak softly, wake her not.
line 10243-->  FIRST GUARD. Caesar hath sent-
line 10244-->  CHARMIAN. Too slow a messenger.               [Applies an asp]
line 10245-->    O, come apace, dispatch. I partly feel thee.
line 10246-->  FIRST GUARD. Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguil'd.
line 10247-->  SECOND GUARD. There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
line 10248-->  FIRST GUARD. What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
line 10249-->  CHARMIAN. It is well done, and fitting for a princes  
line 10250-->    Descended of so many royal kings.
line 10251-->    Ah, soldier!                                 [CHARMIAN dies]
line 10252-->
line 10253-->                      Re-enter DOLABELLA
line 10254-->
line 10255-->  DOLABELLA. How goes it here?
line 10256-->  SECOND GUARD. All dead.
line 10257-->  DOLABELLA. Caesar, thy thoughts
line 10258-->    Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming
line 10259-->    To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
line 10260-->    So sought'st to hinder.
line 10261-->                      [Within: 'A way there, a way for Caesar!']
line 10262-->
line 10263-->              Re-enter CAESAR and all his train
line 10264-->
line 10265-->  DOLABELLA. O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
line 10266-->    That you did fear is done.
line 10267-->  CAESAR. Bravest at the last,
line 10268-->    She levell'd at our purposes, and being royal,
line 10269-->    Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?  
line 10270-->    I do not see them bleed.
line 10271-->  DOLABELLA. Who was last with them?
line 10272-->  FIRST GUARD. A simple countryman that brought her figs.
line 10273-->    This was his basket.
line 10274-->  CAESAR. Poison'd then.
line 10275-->  FIRST GUARD. O Caesar,
line 10276-->    This Charmian liv'd but now; she stood and spake.
line 10277-->    I found her trimming up the diadem
line 10278-->    On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood,
line 10279-->    And on the sudden dropp'd.
line 10280-->  CAESAR. O noble weakness!
line 10281-->    If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
line 10282-->    By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
line 10283-->    As she would catch another Antony
line 10284-->    In her strong toil of grace.
line 10285-->  DOLABELLA. Here on her breast
line 10286-->    There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
line 10287-->    The like is on her arm.
line 10288-->  FIRST GUARD. This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
line 10289-->    Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves  
line 10290-->    Upon the caves of Nile.
line 10291-->  CAESAR. Most probable
line 10292-->    That so she died; for her physician tells me
line 10293-->    She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
line 10294-->    Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
line 10295-->    And bear her women from the monument.
line 10296-->    She shall be buried by her Antony;
line 10297-->    No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
line 10298-->    A pair so famous. High events as these
line 10299-->    Strike those that make them; and their story is
line 10300-->    No less in pity than his glory which
line 10301-->    Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
line 10302-->    In solemn show attend this funeral,
line 10303-->    And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
line 10304-->    High order in this great solemnity.                   Exeunt
line 10305-->
line 10306-->
line 10307-->THE END

line 10372-->
line 10373-->SCENE:
line 10374-->OLIVER'S house; FREDERICK'S court; and the Forest of Arden
line 10375-->
line 10376-->ACT I. SCENE I.
line 10377-->Orchard of OLIVER'S house
line 10378-->
line 10379-->Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
line 10380-->
line 10381-->  ORLANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
line 10382-->    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
line 10383-->    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
line 10384-->    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
line 10385-->    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
line 10386-->    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
line 10387-->    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
line 10388-->    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
line 10389-->    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
line 10390-->    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
line 10391-->    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
line 10392-->    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
line 10393-->    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
line 10394-->    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
line 10395-->    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
line 10396-->    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
line 10397-->    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of  
line 10398-->    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
line 10399-->    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
line 10400-->    wise remedy how to avoid it.
line 10401-->
line 10402-->                           Enter OLIVER
line 10403-->
line 10404-->  ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.
line 10405-->  ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
line 10406-->    up.                                           [ADAM retires]
line 10407-->  OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here?
line 10408-->  ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
line 10409-->  OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?
line 10410-->  ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a
line 10411-->    poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
line 10412-->  OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
line 10413-->  ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What
line 10414-->    prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
line 10415-->  OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?
line 10416-->  ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
line 10417-->  OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir?  
line 10418-->  ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are
line 10419-->    my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
line 10420-->    should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better
line 10421-->    in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
line 10422-->    away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as
line 10423-->    much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming
line 10424-->    before me is nearer to his reverence.
line 10425-->  OLIVER. What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
line 10426-->  ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
line 10427-->  OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
line 10428-->  ORLANDO. I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
line 10429-->    Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
line 10430-->    a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not
line 10431-->    take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
line 10432-->    tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.
line 10433-->  ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
line 10434-->    remembrance, be at accord.
line 10435-->  OLIVER. Let me go, I say.
line 10436-->  ORLANDO. I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father
line 10437-->    charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have  
line 10438-->    train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
line 10439-->    gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
line 10440-->    me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
line 10441-->    exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
line 10442-->    allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy
line 10443-->    my fortunes.
line 10444-->  OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
line 10445-->    get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
line 10446-->    some part of your will. I pray you leave me.
line 10447-->  ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
line 10448-->  OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.
line 10449-->  ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
line 10450-->    your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke
line 10451-->    such a word.
line 10452-->                                         Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
line 10453-->  OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic
line 10454-->    your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla,
line 10455-->    Dennis!
line 10456-->
line 10457-->                          Enter DENNIS  
line 10458-->
line 10459-->  DENNIS. Calls your worship?
line 10460-->  OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
line 10461-->  DENNIS. So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access
line 10462-->    to you.
line 10463-->  OLIVER. Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and
line 10464-->    to-morrow the wrestling is.
line 10465-->
line 10466-->                          Enter CHARLES
line 10467-->
line 10468-->  CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.
line 10469-->  OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new
line 10470-->    court?
line 10471-->  CHARLES. There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
line 10472-->    is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;
line 10473-->    and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
line 10474-->    exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;
line 10475-->    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
line 10476-->  OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished
line 10477-->    with her father?  
line 10478-->  CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
line 10479-->    being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
line 10480-->    followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at
line 10481-->    the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
line 10482-->    daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
line 10483-->  OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?
line 10484-->  CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many
line 10485-->    merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood
line 10486-->    of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
line 10487-->    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
line 10488-->  OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
line 10489-->  CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
line 10490-->    matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
line 10491-->    brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
line 10492-->    me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he
line 10493-->    that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
line 10494-->    Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would
line 10495-->    be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come
line 10496-->    in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint
line 10497-->    you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,  
line 10498-->    or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
line 10499-->    thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
line 10500-->  OLIVER. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
line 10501-->    find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my
line 10502-->    brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to
line 10503-->    dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,
line 10504-->    Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of
line 10505-->    ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret
line 10506-->    and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
line 10507-->    Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his
line 10508-->    neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou
line 10509-->    dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
line 10510-->    himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap
line 10511-->    thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he
line 10512-->    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I
line 10513-->    assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one
line 10514-->    so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly
line 10515-->    of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush
line 10516-->    and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
line 10517-->  CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come  
line 10518-->    to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,
line 10519-->    I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!
line 10520--> Exit
line 10521-->  OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I
line 10522-->    hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
line 10523-->    hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and
line 10524-->    yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
line 10525-->    beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and
line 10526-->    especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am
line 10527-->    altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
line 10528-->    shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy
line 10529-->    thither, which now I'll go about.                       Exit

line 10545-->SCENE II.
line 10546-->A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
line 10547-->
line 10548-->Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
line 10549-->
line 10550-->  CELIA. I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
line 10551-->  ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and
line 10552-->    would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget
line 10553-->    a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
line 10554-->    extraordinary pleasure.
line 10555-->  CELIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
line 10556-->    love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
line 10557-->    uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I
line 10558-->    could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst
line 10559-->    thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
line 10560-->    as mine is to thee.
line 10561-->  ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
line 10562-->    rejoice in yours.
line 10563-->  CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
line 10564-->    have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
line 10565-->    he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee
line 10566-->    again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that  
line 10567-->    oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
line 10568-->    Rose, be merry.
line 10569-->  ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
line 10570-->    Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
line 10571-->  CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
line 10572-->    in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
line 10573-->    of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
line 10574-->  ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?
line 10575-->  CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
line 10576-->    wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
line 10577-->  ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
line 10578-->    misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
line 10579-->    gifts to women.
line 10580-->  CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
line 10581-->    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
line 10582-->    ill-favouredly.
line 10583-->  ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
line 10584-->    Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
line 10585-->    Nature.
line 10586-->  
line 10587-->                         Enter TOUCHSTONE
line 10588-->
line 10589-->  CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
line 10590-->    Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to
line 10591-->    flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
line 10592-->    the argument?
line 10593-->  ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
line 10594-->    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.
line 10595-->  CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
line 10596-->    Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
line 10597-->    such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
line 10598-->    always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How
line 10599-->    now, wit! Whither wander you?
line 10600-->  TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.
line 10601-->  CELIA. Were you made the messenger?
line 10602-->  TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
line 10603-->  ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?
line 10604-->  TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
line 10605-->    good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.
line 10606-->    Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard  
line 10607-->    was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
line 10608-->  CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
line 10609-->  ROSALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
line 10610-->  TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
line 10611-->    by your beards that I am a knave.
line 10612-->  CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
line 10613-->  TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
line 10614-->    swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
line 10615-->    knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
line 10616-->    had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
line 10617-->    that mustard.
line 10618-->  CELIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
line 10619-->  TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
line 10620-->  CELIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no
line 10621-->    more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
line 10622-->  TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
line 10623-->    men do foolishly.
line 10624-->  CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
line 10625-->    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
line 10626-->    makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.  
line 10627-->
line 10628-->                           Enter LE BEAU
line 10629-->
line 10630-->  ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.
line 10631-->  CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
line 10632-->  ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
line 10633-->  CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
line 10634-->    Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
line 10635-->  LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
line 10636-->  CELIA. Sport! of what colour?
line 10637-->  LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
line 10638-->  ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.
line 10639-->  TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.
line 10640-->  CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
line 10641-->  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-
line 10642-->  ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.
line 10643-->  LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
line 10644-->    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
line 10645-->  ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
line 10646-->  LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your  
line 10647-->    ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
line 10648-->    here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
line 10649-->  CELIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
line 10650-->  LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-
line 10651-->  CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.
line 10652-->  LE BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
line 10653-->  ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by
line 10654-->    these presents'-
line 10655-->  LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
line 10656-->    wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
line 10657-->    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd
line 10658-->    the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
line 10659-->    their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
line 10660-->    beholders take his part with weeping.
line 10661-->  ROSALIND. Alas!
line 10662-->  TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
line 10663-->    lost?
line 10664-->  LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.
line 10665-->  TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time
line 10666-->    that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.  
line 10667-->  CELIA. Or I, I promise thee.
line 10668-->  ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
line 10669-->    his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we
line 10670-->    see this wrestling, cousin?
line 10671-->  LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
line 10672-->    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
line 10673-->  CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.
line 10674-->
line 10675-->           Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,
line 10676-->                     CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS
line 10677-->
line 10678-->  FREDERICK. Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own
line 10679-->    peril on his forwardness.
line 10680-->  ROSALIND. Is yonder the man?
line 10681-->  LE BEAU. Even he, madam.
line 10682-->  CELIA. Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
line 10683-->  FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to
line 10684-->    see the wrestling?
line 10685-->  ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
line 10686-->  FREDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,  
line 10687-->    there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth
line 10688-->    I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to
line 10689-->    him, ladies; see if you can move him.
line 10690-->  CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
line 10691-->  FREDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.
line 10692-->                                     [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]
line 10693-->  LE BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
line 10694-->  ORLANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.
line 10695-->  ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
line 10696-->  ORLANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come
line 10697-->    but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
line 10698-->  CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
line 10699-->    You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw
line 10700-->    yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the
line 10701-->    fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
line 10702-->    enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own
line 10703-->    safety and give over this attempt.
line 10704-->  ROSALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be
line 10705-->    misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the
line 10706-->    wrestling might not go forward.  
line 10707-->  ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,
line 10708-->    wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
line 10709-->    ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
line 10710-->    with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one
line 10711-->    sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is
line 10712-->    willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none
line 10713-->    to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only
line 10714-->    in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when
line 10715-->    I have made it empty.
line 10716-->  ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with
line 10717-->    you.
line 10718-->  CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.
line 10719-->  ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
line 10720-->  CELIA. Your heart's desires be with you!
line 10721-->  CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
line 10722-->    lie with his mother earth?
line 10723-->  ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
line 10724-->  FREDERICK. You shall try but one fall.
line 10725-->  CHARLES. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a
line 10726-->    second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.  
line 10727-->  ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me
line 10728-->    before; but come your ways.
line 10729-->  ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
line 10730-->  CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the
line 10731-->    leg.                                          [They wrestle]
line 10732-->  ROSALIND. O excellent young man!
line 10733-->  CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should
line 10734-->    down.
line 10735-->                                      [CHARLES is thrown. Shout]
line 10736-->  FREDERICK. No more, no more.
line 10737-->  ORLANDO. Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
line 10738-->  FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?
line 10739-->  LE BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.
line 10740-->  FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
line 10741-->  ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
line 10742-->    Boys.
line 10743-->  FREDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
line 10744-->    The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
line 10745-->    But I did find him still mine enemy.
line 10746-->    Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,  
line 10747-->    Hadst thou descended from another house.
line 10748-->    But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;
line 10749-->    I would thou hadst told me of another father.
line 10750-->                                 Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU
line 10751-->  CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
line 10752-->  ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
line 10753-->    His youngest son- and would not change that calling
line 10754-->    To be adopted heir to Frederick.
line 10755-->  ROSALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
line 10756-->    And all the world was of my father's mind;
line 10757-->    Had I before known this young man his son,
line 10758-->    I should have given him tears unto entreaties
line 10759-->    Ere he should thus have ventur'd.
line 10760-->  CELIA. Gentle cousin,
line 10761-->    Let us go thank him, and encourage him;
line 10762-->    My father's rough and envious disposition
line 10763-->    Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserv'd;
line 10764-->    If you do keep your promises in love
line 10765-->    But justly as you have exceeded all promise,
line 10766-->    Your mistress shall be happy.  
line 10767-->  ROSALIND. Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
line 10768-->    Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,
line 10769-->    That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
line 10770-->    Shall we go, coz?
line 10771-->  CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
line 10772-->  ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts
line 10773-->    Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up
line 10774-->    Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
line 10775-->  ROSALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;
line 10776-->    I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
line 10777-->    Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
line 10778-->    More than your enemies.
line 10779-->  CELIA. Will you go, coz?
line 10780-->  ROSALIND. Have with you. Fare you well.
line 10781-->                                       Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
line 10782-->  ORLANDO. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
line 10783-->    I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
line 10784-->    O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
line 10785-->    Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
line 10786-->  
line 10787-->                      Re-enter LE BEAU
line 10788-->
line 10789-->  LE BEAU. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
line 10790-->    To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd
line 10791-->    High commendation, true applause, and love,
line 10792-->    Yet such is now the Duke's condition
line 10793-->    That he misconstrues all that you have done.
line 10794-->    The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,
line 10795-->    More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
line 10796-->  ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
line 10797-->    Which of the two was daughter of the Duke
line 10798-->    That here was at the wrestling?
line 10799-->  LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
line 10800-->    But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;
line 10801-->    The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,
line 10802-->    And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
line 10803-->    To keep his daughter company; whose loves
line 10804-->    Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
line 10805-->    But I can tell you that of late this Duke
line 10806-->    Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,  
line 10807-->    Grounded upon no other argument
line 10808-->    But that the people praise her for her virtues
line 10809-->    And pity her for her good father's sake;
line 10810-->    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
line 10811-->    Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.
line 10812-->    Hereafter, in a better world than this,
line 10813-->    I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
line 10814-->  ORLANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.
line 10815-->                                                    Exit LE BEAU
line 10816-->    Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
line 10817-->    From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.
line 10818-->    But heavenly Rosalind!                                  Exit
line 10819-->
line 10820-->
line 10821-->
line 10822-->
line 10823-->SCENE III.
line 10824-->The DUKE's palace
line 10825-->
line 10826-->Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
line 10827-->
line 10828-->  CELIA. Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!
line 10829-->    Not a word?
line 10830-->  ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.
line 10831-->  CELIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;
line 10832-->    throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
line 10833-->  ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should
line 10834-->    be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.
line 10835-->  CELIA. But is all this for your father?
line 10836-->  ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of
line 10837-->    briers is this working-day world!
line 10838-->  CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
line 10839-->    foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats
line 10840-->    will catch them.
line 10841-->  ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my
line 10842-->    heart.
line 10843-->  CELIA. Hem them away.
line 10844-->  ROSALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.  
line 10845-->  CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
line 10846-->  ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
line 10847-->  CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
line 10848-->    a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in
line 10849-->    good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall
line 10850-->    into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
line 10851-->  ROSALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
line 10852-->  CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
line 10853-->    By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his
line 10854-->    father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
line 10855-->  ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
line 10856-->  CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
line 10857-->
line 10858-->                    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
line 10859-->
line 10860-->  ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I
line 10861-->    do. Look, here comes the Duke.
line 10862-->  CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.
line 10863-->  FREDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
line 10864-->    And get you from our court.  
line 10865-->  ROSALIND. Me, uncle?
line 10866-->  FREDERICK. You, cousin.
line 10867-->    Within these ten days if that thou beest found
line 10868-->    So near our public court as twenty miles,
line 10869-->    Thou diest for it.
line 10870-->  ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
line 10871-->    Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
line 10872-->    If with myself I hold intelligence,
line 10873-->    Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;
line 10874-->    If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-
line 10875-->    As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,
line 10876-->    Never so much as in a thought unborn
line 10877-->    Did I offend your Highness.
line 10878-->  FREDERICK. Thus do all traitors;
line 10879-->    If their purgation did consist in words,
line 10880-->    They are as innocent as grace itself.
line 10881-->    Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
line 10882-->  ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
line 10883-->    Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
line 10884-->  FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.  
line 10885-->  ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
line 10886-->    So was I when your Highness banish'd him.
line 10887-->    Treason is not inherited, my lord;
line 10888-->    Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
line 10889-->    What's that to me? My father was no traitor.
line 10890-->    Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
line 10891-->    To think my poverty is treacherous.
line 10892-->  CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
line 10893-->  FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
line 10894-->    Else had she with her father rang'd along.
line 10895-->  CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;
line 10896-->    It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;
line 10897-->    I was too young that time to value her,
line 10898-->    But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
line 10899-->    Why so am I: we still have slept together,
line 10900-->    Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
line 10901-->    And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
line 10902-->    Still we went coupled and inseparable.
line 10903-->  FREDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
line 10904-->    Her very silence and her patience,  
line 10905-->    Speak to the people, and they pity her.
line 10906-->    Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;
line 10907-->    And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
line 10908-->    When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
line 10909-->    Firm and irrevocable is my doom
line 10910-->    Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
line 10911-->  CELIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
line 10912-->    I cannot live out of her company.
line 10913-->  FREDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
line 10914-->    If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
line 10915-->    And in the greatness of my word, you die.
line 10916-->                                           Exeunt DUKE and LORDS
line 10917-->  CELIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
line 10918-->    Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
line 10919-->    I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.
line 10920-->  ROSALIND. I have more cause.
line 10921-->  CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin.
line 10922-->    Prithee be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke
line 10923-->    Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
line 10924-->  ROSALIND. That he hath not.  
line 10925-->  CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
line 10926-->    Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
line 10927-->    Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?
line 10928-->    No; let my father seek another heir.
line 10929-->    Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
line 10930-->    Whither to go, and what to bear with us;
line 10931-->    And do not seek to take your charge upon you,
line 10932-->    To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;
line 10933-->    For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
line 10934-->    Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
line 10935-->  ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go?
line 10936-->  CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
line 10937-->  ROSALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
line 10938-->    Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
line 10939-->    Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
line 10940-->  CELIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
line 10941-->    And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
line 10942-->    The like do you; so shall we pass along,
line 10943-->    And never stir assailants.
line 10944-->  ROSALIND. Were it not better,  
line 10945-->    Because that I am more than common tall,
line 10946-->    That I did suit me all points like a man?
line 10947-->    A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
line 10948-->    A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
line 10949-->    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-
line 10950-->    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
line 10951-->    As many other mannish cowards have
line 10952-->    That do outface it with their semblances.
line 10953-->  CELIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
line 10954-->  ROSALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
line 10955-->    And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
line 10956-->    But what will you be call'd?
line 10957-->  CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:
line 10958-->    No longer Celia, but Aliena.
line 10959-->  ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
line 10960-->    The clownish fool out of your father's court?
line 10961-->    Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
line 10962-->  CELIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
line 10963-->    Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
line 10964-->    And get our jewels and our wealth together;  
line 10965-->    Devise the fittest time and safest way
line 10966-->    To hide us from pursuit that will be made
line 10967-->    After my flight. Now go we in content
line 10968-->    To liberty, and not to banishment.                    Exeunt
line 10969-->

line 10984-->ACT II. SCENE I.
line 10985-->The Forest of Arden
line 10986-->
line 10987-->Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three LORDS, like foresters
line 10988-->
line 10989-->  DUKE SENIOR. Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
line 10990-->    Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
line 10991-->    Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
line 10992-->    More free from peril than the envious court?
line 10993-->    Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
line 10994-->    The seasons' difference; as the icy fang
line 10995-->    And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
line 10996-->    Which when it bites and blows upon my body,
line 10997-->    Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
line 10998-->    'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
line 10999-->    That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
line 11000-->    Sweet are the uses of adversity,
line 11001-->    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
line 11002-->    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
line 11003-->    And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
line 11004-->    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,  
line 11005-->    Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
line 11006-->    I would not change it.
line 11007-->  AMIENS. Happy is your Grace,
line 11008-->    That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
line 11009-->    Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
line 11010-->  DUKE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
line 11011-->    And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
line 11012-->    Being native burghers of this desert city,
line 11013-->    Should, in their own confines, with forked heads
line 11014-->    Have their round haunches gor'd.
line 11015-->  FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord,
line 11016-->    The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;
line 11017-->    And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
line 11018-->    Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
line 11019-->    To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
line 11020-->    Did steal behind him as he lay along
line 11021-->    Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
line 11022-->    Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
line 11023-->    To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,
line 11024-->    That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,  
line 11025-->    Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
line 11026-->    The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
line 11027-->    That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
line 11028-->    Almost to bursting; and the big round tears
line 11029-->    Cours'd one another down his innocent nose
line 11030-->    In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
line 11031-->    Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
line 11032-->    Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
line 11033-->    Augmenting it with tears.
line 11034-->  DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?
line 11035-->    Did he not moralize this spectacle?
line 11036-->  FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.
line 11037-->    First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
line 11038-->    'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
line 11039-->    As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
line 11040-->    To that which had too much.' Then, being there alone,
line 11041-->    Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
line 11042-->    ''Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part
line 11043-->    The flux of company.' Anon, a careless herd,
line 11044-->    Full of the pasture, jumps along by him  
line 11045-->    And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
line 11046-->    'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
line 11047-->    'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
line 11048-->    Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
line 11049-->    Thus most invectively he pierceth through
line 11050-->    The body of the country, city, court,
line 11051-->    Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
line 11052-->    Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
line 11053-->    To fright the animals, and to kill them up
line 11054-->    In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
line 11055-->  DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?
line 11056-->  SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
line 11057-->    Upon the sobbing deer.
line 11058-->  DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place;
line 11059-->    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
line 11060-->    For then he's full of matter.
line 11061-->  FIRST LORD. I'll bring you to him straight.             Exeunt
line 11062-->
line 11063-->
line 11064-->
line 11065-->
line 11066-->SCENE II.
line 11067-->The DUKE'S palace
line 11068-->
line 11069-->Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
line 11070-->
line 11071-->  FREDERICK. Can it be possible that no man saw them?
line 11072-->    It cannot be; some villains of my court
line 11073-->    Are of consent and sufferance in this.
line 11074-->  FIRST LORD. I cannot hear of any that did see her.
line 11075-->    The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
line 11076-->    Saw her abed, and in the morning early
line 11077-->    They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.
line 11078-->  SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
line 11079-->    Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
line 11080-->    Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,
line 11081-->    Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
line 11082-->    Your daughter and her cousin much commend
line 11083-->    The parts and graces of the wrestler
line 11084-->    That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
line 11085-->    And she believes, wherever they are gone,
line 11086-->    That youth is surely in their company.
line 11087-->  FREDERICK. Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.  
line 11088-->    If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
line 11089-->    I'll make him find him. Do this suddenly;
line 11090-->    And let not search and inquisition quail
line 11091-->    To bring again these foolish runaways.                Exeunt
line 11092-->
line 11093-->
line 11094-->
line 11095-->
line 11096-->SCENE III.
line 11097-->Before OLIVER'S house
line 11098-->
line 11099-->Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting
line 11100-->
line 11101-->  ORLANDO. Who's there?
line 11102-->  ADAM. What, my young master? O my gentle master!
line 11103-->    O my sweet master! O you memory
line 11104-->    Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
line 11105-->    Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
line 11106-->    And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
line 11107-->    Why would you be so fond to overcome
line 11108-->    The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?
line 11109-->    Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
line 11110-->    Know you not, master, to some kind of men
line 11111-->    Their graces serve them but as enemies?
line 11112-->    No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
line 11113-->    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
line 11114-->    O, what a world is this, when what is comely
line 11115-->    Envenoms him that bears it!
line 11116-->  ORLANDO. Why, what's the matter?
line 11117-->  ADAM. O unhappy youth!  
line 11118-->    Come not within these doors; within this roof
line 11119-->    The enemy of all your graces lives.
line 11120-->    Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
line 11121-->    Yet not the son; I will not call him son
line 11122-->    Of him I was about to call his father-
line 11123-->    Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
line 11124-->    To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
line 11125-->    And you within it. If he fail of that,
line 11126-->    He will have other means to cut you off;
line 11127-->    I overheard him and his practices.
line 11128-->    This is no place; this house is but a butchery;
line 11129-->    Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
line 11130-->  ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
line 11131-->  ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.
line 11132-->  ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
line 11133-->    Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
line 11134-->    A thievish living on the common road?
line 11135-->    This I must do, or know not what to do;
line 11136-->    Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
line 11137-->    I rather will subject me to the malice  
line 11138-->    Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
line 11139-->  ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
line 11140-->    The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,
line 11141-->    Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
line 11142-->    When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
line 11143-->    And unregarded age in corners thrown.
line 11144-->    Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
line 11145-->    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
line 11146-->    Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
line 11147-->    All this I give you. Let me be your servant;
line 11148-->    Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
line 11149-->    For in my youth I never did apply
line 11150-->    Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
line 11151-->    Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
line 11152-->    The means of weakness and debility;
line 11153-->    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
line 11154-->    Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;
line 11155-->    I'll do the service of a younger man
line 11156-->    In all your business and necessities.
line 11157-->  ORLANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appears  
line 11158-->    The constant service of the antique world,
line 11159-->    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
line 11160-->    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
line 11161-->    Where none will sweat but for promotion,
line 11162-->    And having that do choke their service up
line 11163-->    Even with the having; it is not so with thee.
line 11164-->    But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree
line 11165-->    That cannot so much as a blossom yield
line 11166-->    In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
line 11167-->    But come thy ways, we'll go along together,
line 11168-->    And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
line 11169-->    We'll light upon some settled low content.
line 11170-->  ADAM. Master, go on; and I will follow the
line 11171-->    To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
line 11172-->    From seventeen years till now almost four-score
line 11173-->    Here lived I, but now live here no more.
line 11174-->    At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
line 11175-->    But at fourscore it is too late a week;
line 11176-->    Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
line 11177-->    Than to die well and not my master's debtor.          Exeunt

line 11182-->SCENE IV.
line 11183-->The Forest of Arden
line 11184-->
line 11185-->Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE
line 11186-->
line 11187-->  ROSALIND. O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
line 11188-->  TOUCHSTONE. I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
line 11189-->  ROSALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,
line 11190-->    and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as
line 11191-->    doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat;
line 11192-->    therefore, courage, good Aliena.
line 11193-->  CELIA. I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
line 11194-->  TOUCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;
line 11195-->    yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you; for I think you
line 11196-->    have no money in your purse.
line 11197-->  ROSALIND. Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
line 11198-->  TOUCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
line 11199-->    home I was in a better place; but travellers must be content.
line 11200-->
line 11201-->                        Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
line 11202-->  
line 11203-->  ROSALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a
line 11204-->    young man and an old in solemn talk.
line 11205-->  CORIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.
line 11206-->  SILVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
line 11207-->  CORIN. I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
line 11208-->  SILVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
line 11209-->    Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
line 11210-->    As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
line 11211-->    But if thy love were ever like to mine,
line 11212-->    As sure I think did never man love so,
line 11213-->    How many actions most ridiculous
line 11214-->    Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
line 11215-->  CORIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
line 11216-->  SILVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
line 11217-->    If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
line 11218-->    That ever love did make thee run into,
line 11219-->    Thou hast not lov'd;
line 11220-->    Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
line 11221-->    Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
line 11222-->    Thou hast not lov'd;  
line 11223-->    Or if thou hast not broke from company
line 11224-->    Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
line 11225-->    Thou hast not lov'd.
line 11226-->    O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius
line 11227-->  ROSALIND. Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
line 11228-->    I have by hard adventure found mine own.
line 11229-->  TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my
line 11230-->    sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to
line 11231-->    Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the
line 11232-->    cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember
line 11233-->    the wooing of  peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods,
line 11234-->    and giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these
line 11235-->    for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers;
line 11236-->    but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal
line 11237-->    in folly.
line 11238-->  ROSALIND. Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
line 11239-->  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
line 11240-->    my shins against it.
line 11241-->  ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
line 11242-->    Is much upon my fashion.  
line 11243-->  TOUCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
line 11244-->  CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man
line 11245-->    If he for gold will give us any food;
line 11246-->    I faint almost to death.
line 11247-->  TOUCHSTONE. Holla, you clown!
line 11248-->  ROSALIND. Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
line 11249-->  CORIN. Who calls?
line 11250-->  TOUCHSTONE. Your betters, sir.
line 11251-->  CORIN. Else are they very wretched.
line 11252-->  ROSALIND. Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
line 11253-->  CORIN. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
line 11254-->  ROSALIND. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
line 11255-->    Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
line 11256-->    Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
line 11257-->    Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,
line 11258-->    And faints for succour.
line 11259-->  CORIN. Fair sir, I pity her,
line 11260-->    And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
line 11261-->    My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
line 11262-->    But I am shepherd to another man,  
line 11263-->    And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
line 11264-->    My master is of churlish disposition,
line 11265-->    And little recks to find the way to heaven
line 11266-->    By doing deeds of hospitality.
line 11267-->    Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,
line 11268-->    Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,
line 11269-->    By reason of his absence, there is nothing
line 11270-->    That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
line 11271-->    And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
line 11272-->  ROSALIND. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
line 11273-->  CORIN. That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
line 11274-->    That little cares for buying any thing.
line 11275-->  ROSALIND. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
line 11276-->    Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
line 11277-->    And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
line 11278-->  CELIA. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
line 11279-->    And willingly could waste my time in it.
line 11280-->  CORIN. Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
line 11281-->    Go with me; if you like upon report
line 11282-->    The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,  
line 11283-->    I will your very faithful feeder be,
line 11284-->    And buy it with your gold right suddenly.             Exeunt

line 11290-->Another part of the forest
line 11291-->
line 11292-->Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and OTHERS
line 11293-->
line 11294-->                       SONG
line 11295-->  AMIENS.    Under the greenwood tree
line 11296-->               Who loves to lie with me,
line 11297-->               And turn his merry note
line 11298-->               Unto the sweet bird's throat,
line 11299-->             Come hither, come hither, come hither.
line 11300-->               Here shall he see
line 11301-->               No enemy
line 11302-->             But winter and rough weather.
line 11303-->
line 11304-->  JAQUES. More, more, I prithee, more.
line 11305-->  AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
line 11306-->  JAQUES. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy
line 11307-->    out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.
line 11308-->  AMIENS. My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
line 11309-->  JAQUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.
line 11310-->    Come, more; another stanzo. Call you 'em stanzos?  
line 11311-->  AMIENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
line 11312-->  JAQUES. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Will
line 11313-->    you sing?
line 11314-->  AMIENS. More at your request than to please myself.
line 11315-->  JAQUES. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but
line 11316-->    that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes;
line 11317-->    and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a
line 11318-->    penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you
line 11319-->    that will not, hold your tongues.
line 11320-->  AMIENS. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
line 11321-->    will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look
line 11322-->    you.
line 11323-->  JAQUES. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is to
line 11324-->    disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he; but
line 11325-->    I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come, warble,
line 11326-->    come.
line 11327-->
line 11328-->                       SONG
line 11329-->              [All together here]
line 11330-->  
line 11331-->           Who doth ambition shun,
line 11332-->           And loves to live i' th' sun,
line 11333-->           Seeking the food he eats,
line 11334-->           And pleas'd with what he gets,
line 11335-->         Come hither, come hither, come hither.
line 11336-->           Here shall he see
line 11337-->           No enemy
line 11338-->           But winter and rough weather.
line 11339-->
line 11340-->  JAQUES. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
line 11341-->    despite of my invention.
line 11342-->  AMIENS. And I'll sing it.
line 11343-->  JAQUES. Thus it goes:
line 11344-->
line 11345-->             If it do come to pass
line 11346-->             That any man turn ass,
line 11347-->             Leaving his wealth and ease
line 11348-->             A stubborn will to please,
line 11349-->           Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
line 11350-->             Here shall he see  
line 11351-->             Gross fools as he,
line 11352-->             An if he will come to me.
line 11353-->
line 11354-->  AMIENS. What's that 'ducdame'?
line 11355-->  JAQUES. 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll
line 11356-->    go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll rail against all the
line 11357-->    first-born of Egypt.
line 11358-->  AMIENS. And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
line 11359-->                                                Exeunt severally

line 11365-->The forest
line 11366-->
line 11367-->Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
line 11368-->
line 11369-->  ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
line 11370-->    I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
line 11371-->  ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
line 11372-->    little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth
line 11373-->    forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
line 11374-->    bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
line 11375-->    powers. For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the
line 11376-->    arm's end. I will here be with the presently; and if I bring thee
line 11377-->    not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou
line 11378-->    diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
line 11379-->    thou look'st cheerly; and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou
line 11380-->    liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter;
line 11381-->    and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live
line 11382-->    anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam!          Exeunt

line 11386-->
line 11387-->SCENE VII.
line 11388-->The forest
line 11389-->
line 11390-->A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
line 11391-->
line 11392-->  DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast;
line 11393-->    For I can nowhere find him like a man.
line 11394-->  FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
line 11395-->    Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
line 11396-->  DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
line 11397-->    We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
line 11398-->    Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.
line 11399-->
line 11400-->                         Enter JAQUES
line 11401-->
line 11402-->  FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.
line 11403-->  DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
line 11404-->    That your poor friends must woo your company?
line 11405-->    What, you look merrily!
line 11406-->  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
line 11407-->    A motley fool. A miserable world!  
line 11408-->    As I do live by food, I met a fool,
line 11409-->    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
line 11410-->    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
line 11411-->    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.
line 11412-->    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,
line 11413-->    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'
line 11414-->    And then he drew a dial from his poke,
line 11415-->    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
line 11416-->    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;
line 11417-->    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;
line 11418-->    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
line 11419-->    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
line 11420-->    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
line 11421-->    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
line 11422-->    And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
line 11423-->    The motley fool thus moral on the time,
line 11424-->    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
line 11425-->    That fools should be so deep contemplative;
line 11426-->    And I did laugh sans intermission
line 11427-->    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!  
line 11428-->    A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
line 11429-->  DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?
line 11430-->  JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
line 11431-->    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
line 11432-->    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
line 11433-->    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
line 11434-->    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
line 11435-->    With observation, the which he vents
line 11436-->    In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
line 11437-->    I am ambitious for a motley coat.
line 11438-->  DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.
line 11439-->  JAQUES. It is my only suit,
line 11440-->    Provided that you weed your better judgments
line 11441-->    Of all opinion that grows rank in them
line 11442-->    That I am wise. I must have liberty
line 11443-->    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
line 11444-->    To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;
line 11445-->    And they that are most galled with my folly,
line 11446-->    They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
line 11447-->    The why is plain as way to parish church:  
line 11448-->    He that a fool doth very wisely hit
line 11449-->    Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
line 11450-->    Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
line 11451-->    The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
line 11452-->    Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
line 11453-->    Invest me in my motley; give me leave
line 11454-->    To speak my mind, and I will through and through
line 11455-->    Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
line 11456-->    If they will patiently receive my medicine.
line 11457-->  DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
line 11458-->  JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?
line 11459-->  DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
line 11460-->    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
line 11461-->    As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
line 11462-->    And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
line 11463-->    That thou with license of free foot hast caught
line 11464-->    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
line 11465-->  JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride
line 11466-->    That can therein tax any private party?
line 11467-->    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,  
line 11468-->    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
line 11469-->    What woman in the city do I name
line 11470-->    When that I say the city-woman bears
line 11471-->    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
line 11472-->    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
line 11473-->    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
line 11474-->    Or what is he of basest function
line 11475-->    That says his bravery is not on my cost,
line 11476-->    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
line 11477-->    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
line 11478-->    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
line 11479-->    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
line 11480-->    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
line 11481-->    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
line 11482-->    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
line 11483-->
line 11484-->             Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn
line 11485-->
line 11486-->  ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.
line 11487-->  JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.  
line 11488-->  ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
line 11489-->  JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?
line 11490-->  DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
line 11491-->    Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
line 11492-->    That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
line 11493-->  ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
line 11494-->    Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
line 11495-->    Of smooth civility; yet arn I inland bred,
line 11496-->    And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;
line 11497-->    He dies that touches any of this fruit
line 11498-->    Till I and my affairs are answered.
line 11499-->  JAQUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
line 11500-->  DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
line 11501-->    More than your force move us to gentleness.
line 11502-->  ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.
line 11503-->  DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
line 11504-->  ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
line 11505-->    I thought that all things had been savage here,
line 11506-->    And therefore put I on the countenance
line 11507-->    Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are  
line 11508-->    That in this desert inaccessible,
line 11509-->    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
line 11510-->    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
line 11511-->    If ever you have look'd on better days,
line 11512-->    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
line 11513-->    If ever sat at any good man's feast,
line 11514-->    If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
line 11515-->    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
line 11516-->    Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;
line 11517-->    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
line 11518-->  DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
line 11519-->    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
line 11520-->    And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes
line 11521-->    Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;
line 11522-->    And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
line 11523-->    And take upon command what help we have
line 11524-->    That to your wanting may be minist'red.
line 11525-->  ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,
line 11526-->    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
line 11527-->    And give it food. There is an old poor man  
line 11528-->    Who after me hath many a weary step
line 11529-->    Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,
line 11530-->    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
line 11531-->    I will not touch a bit.
line 11532-->  DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out.
line 11533-->    And we will nothing waste till you return.
line 11534-->  ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
line 11535--> Exit
line 11536-->  DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
line 11537-->    This wide and universal theatre
line 11538-->    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
line 11539-->    Wherein we play in.
line 11540-->  JAQUES. All the world's a stage,
line 11541-->    And all the men and women merely players;
line 11542-->    They have their exits and their entrances;
line 11543-->    And one man in his time plays many parts,
line 11544-->    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
line 11545-->    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
line 11546-->    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
line 11547-->    And shining morning face, creeping like snail  
line 11548-->    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
line 11549-->    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
line 11550-->    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
line 11551-->    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
line 11552-->    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
line 11553-->    Seeking the bubble reputation
line 11554-->    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
line 11555-->    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
line 11556-->    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
line 11557-->    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
line 11558-->    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
line 11559-->    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
line 11560-->    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
line 11561-->    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
line 11562-->    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
line 11563-->    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
line 11564-->    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
line 11565-->    That ends this strange eventful history,
line 11566-->    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
line 11567-->    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.  
line 11568-->
line 11569-->                  Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM
line 11570-->
line 11571-->  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.
line 11572-->    And let him feed.
line 11573-->  ORLANDO. I thank you most for him.
line 11574-->  ADAM. So had you need;
line 11575-->    I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
line 11576-->  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
line 11577-->    As yet to question you about your fortunes.
line 11578-->    Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
line 11579-->
line 11580-->                         SONG
line 11581-->            Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
line 11582-->            Thou art not so unkind
line 11583-->              As man's ingratitude;
line 11584-->            Thy tooth is not so keen,
line 11585-->            Because thou art not seen,
line 11586-->              Although thy breath be rude.
line 11587-->    Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly.  
line 11588-->    Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
line 11589-->            Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
line 11590-->              This life is most jolly.
line 11591-->
line 11592-->            Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
line 11593-->            That dost not bite so nigh
line 11594-->              As benefits forgot;
line 11595-->            Though thou the waters warp,
line 11596-->            Thy sting is not so sharp
line 11597-->              As friend rememb'red not.
line 11598-->    Heigh-ho! sing, &c.
line 11599-->
line 11600-->  DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
line 11601-->    As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
line 11602-->    And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
line 11603-->    Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
line 11604-->    Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
line 11605-->    That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,
line 11606-->    Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
line 11607-->    Thou art right welcome as thy master is.  
line 11608-->    Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
line 11609-->    And let me all your fortunes understand.              Exeunt
line 11610-->
line 11611-->
line 11612-->
line 11613-->
line 11614-->ACT III. SCENE I.
line 11615-->The palace
line 11616-->
line 11617-->Enter DUKE FREDERICK, OLIVER, and LORDS
line 11618-->
line 11619-->  FREDERICK. Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.
line 11620-->    But were I not the better part made mercy,
line 11621-->    I should not seek an absent argument
line 11622-->    Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
line 11623-->    Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is;
line 11624-->    Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
line 11625-->    Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
line 11626-->    To seek a living in our territory.
line 11627-->    Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
line 11628-->    Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
line 11629-->    Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
line 11630-->    Of what we think against thee.
line 11631-->  OLIVER. O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
line 11632-->    I never lov'd my brother in my life.
line 11633-->  FREDERICK. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
line 11634-->    And let my officers of such a nature
line 11635-->    Make an extent upon his house and lands.  
line 11636-->    Do this expediently, and turn him going.              Exeunt
line 11637-->
line 11638-->
line 11639-->
line 11640-->
line 11641-->SCENE II.
line 11642-->The forest
line 11643-->
line 11644-->Enter ORLANDO, with a paper
line 11645-->
line 11646-->  ORLANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
line 11647-->    And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
line 11648-->    With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
line 11649-->    Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
line 11650-->    O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
line 11651-->    And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
line 11652-->    That every eye which in this forest looks
line 11653-->    Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
line 11654-->    Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,
line 11655-->    The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.             Exit
line 11656-->
line 11657-->                     Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
line 11658-->
line 11659-->  CORIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
line 11660-->  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
line 11661-->    life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.
line 11662-->    In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in  
line 11663-->    respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in
line 11664-->    respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect
line 11665-->    it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life,
line 11666-->    look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty
line 11667-->    in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in
line 11668-->    thee, shepherd?
line 11669-->  CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
line 11670-->    ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is
line 11671-->    without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,
line 11672-->    and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a
line 11673-->    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath
line 11674-->    learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,
line 11675-->    or comes of a very dull kindred.
line 11676-->  TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
line 11677-->    court, shepherd?
line 11678-->  CORIN. No, truly.
line 11679-->  TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.
line 11680-->  CORIN. Nay, I hope.
line 11681-->  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
line 11682-->    one side.  
line 11683-->  CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
line 11684-->  TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
line 11685-->    manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must
line 11686-->    be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art
line 11687-->    in a parlous state, shepherd.
line 11688-->  CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
line 11689-->    court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
line 11690-->    country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not
line 11691-->    at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be
line 11692-->    uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
line 11693-->  TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.
line 11694-->  CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
line 11695-->    know, are greasy.
line 11696-->  TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
line 11697-->    grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow,
line 11698-->    shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
line 11699-->  CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
line 11700-->  TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A
line 11701-->    more sounder instance; come.
line 11702-->  CORIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our  
line 11703-->    sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are
line 11704-->    perfum'd with civet.
line 11705-->  TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
line 11706-->    piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is
line 11707-->    of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend
line 11708-->    the instance, shepherd.
line 11709-->  CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
line 11710-->  TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God
line 11711-->    make incision in thee! thou art raw.
line 11712-->  CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I
line 11713-->    wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
line 11714-->    men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is
line 11715-->    to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
line 11716-->  TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes
line 11717-->    and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the
line 11718-->    copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray
line 11719-->    a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
line 11720-->    out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this,
line 11721-->    the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how
line 11722-->    thou shouldst scape.  
line 11723-->  CORIN. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
line 11724-->
line 11725-->                  Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper
line 11726-->
line 11727-->  ROSALIND.   'From the east to western Inde,
line 11728-->              No jewel is like Rosalinde.
line 11729-->              Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
line 11730-->              Through all the world bears Rosalinde.
line 11731-->              All the pictures fairest lin'd
line 11732-->              Are but black to Rosalinde.
line 11733-->              Let no face be kept in mind
line 11734-->              But the fair of Rosalinde.'
line 11735-->  TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and
line 11736-->    suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted. It is the right
line 11737-->    butter-women's rank to market.
line 11738-->  ROSALIND. Out, fool!
line 11739-->  TOUCHSTONE.   For a taste:
line 11740-->                If a hart do lack a hind,
line 11741-->                Let him seek out Rosalinde.
line 11742-->                If the cat will after kind,  
line 11743-->                So be sure will Rosalinde.
line 11744-->                Winter garments must be lin'd,
line 11745-->                So must slender Rosalinde.
line 11746-->                They that reap must sheaf and bind,
line 11747-->                Then to cart with Rosalinde.
line 11748-->                Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
line 11749-->                Such a nut is Rosalinde.
line 11750-->                He that sweetest rose will find
line 11751-->                Must find love's prick and Rosalinde.
line 11752-->    This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect
line 11753-->    yourself with them?
line 11754-->  ROSALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
line 11755-->  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
line 11756-->  ROSALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a
line 11757-->    medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for
line 11758-->    you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right
line 11759-->    virtue of the medlar.
line 11760-->  TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest
line 11761-->    judge.
line 11762-->  
line 11763-->                      Enter CELIA, with a writing
line 11764-->
line 11765-->  ROSALIND. Peace!
line 11766-->    Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
line 11767-->  CELIA.   'Why should this a desert be?
line 11768-->             For it is unpeopled? No;
line 11769-->           Tongues I'll hang on every tree
line 11770-->             That shall civil sayings show.
line 11771-->           Some, how brief the life of man
line 11772-->             Runs his erring pilgrimage,
line 11773-->           That the streching of a span
line 11774-->             Buckles in his sum of age;
line 11775-->           Some, of violated vows
line 11776-->             'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
line 11777-->           But upon the fairest boughs,
line 11778-->             Or at every sentence end,
line 11779-->           Will I Rosalinda write,
line 11780-->             Teaching all that read to know
line 11781-->           The quintessence of every sprite
line 11782-->             Heaven would in little show.  
line 11783-->           Therefore heaven Nature charg'd
line 11784-->             That one body should be fill'd
line 11785-->           With all graces wide-enlarg'd.
line 11786-->             Nature presently distill'd
line 11787-->           Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
line 11788-->             Cleopatra's majesty,
line 11789-->           Atalanta's better part,
line 11790-->             Sad Lucretia's modesty.
line 11791-->           Thus Rosalinde of many parts
line 11792-->             By heavenly synod was devis'd,
line 11793-->           Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,
line 11794-->             To have the touches dearest priz'd.
line 11795-->           Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
line 11796-->           And I to live and die her slave.'
line 11797-->  ROSALIND. O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have
line 11798-->    you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have
line 11799-->    patience, good people.'
line 11800-->  CELIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
line 11801-->    him, sirrah.
line 11802-->  TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;  
line 11803-->    though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
line 11804-->                                     Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
line 11805-->  CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
line 11806-->  ROSALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
line 11807-->    had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
line 11808-->  CELIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
line 11809-->  ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
line 11810-->    without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
line 11811-->  CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
line 11812-->    hang'd and carved upon these trees?
line 11813-->  ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
line 11814-->    came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so
line 11815-->    berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, which I
line 11816-->    can hardly remember.
line 11817-->  CELIA. Trow you who hath done this?
line 11818-->  ROSALIND. Is it a man?
line 11819-->  CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
line 11820-->    Change you colour?
line 11821-->  ROSALIND. I prithee, who?
line 11822-->  CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but  
line 11823-->    mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.
line 11824-->  ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?
line 11825-->  CELIA. Is it possible?
line 11826-->  ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
line 11827-->    me who it is.
line 11828-->  CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
line 11829-->    again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
line 11830-->  ROSALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
line 11831-->    caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my
line 11832-->    disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.
line 11833-->    I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would
line 11834-->    thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man
line 11835-->    out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-
line 11836-->    either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork
line 11837-->    out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.
line 11838-->  CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
line 11839-->  ROSALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
line 11840-->    Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
line 11841-->  CELIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.
line 11842-->  ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let  
line 11843-->    me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the
line 11844-->    knowledge of his chin.
line 11845-->  CELIA. It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
line 11846-->    and your heart both in an instant.
line 11847-->  ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
line 11848-->    maid.
line 11849-->  CELIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
line 11850-->  ROSALIND. Orlando?
line 11851-->  CELIA. Orlando.
line 11852-->  ROSALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
line 11853-->    What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?
line 11854-->    Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where
line 11855-->    remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him
line 11856-->    again? Answer me in one word.
line 11857-->  CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
line 11858-->    great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these
line 11859-->    particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
line 11860-->  ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's
line 11861-->    apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
line 11862-->  CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the  
line 11863-->    propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and
line 11864-->    relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a
line 11865-->    dropp'd acorn.
line 11866-->  ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth
line 11867-->    such fruit.
line 11868-->  CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.
line 11869-->  ROSALIND. Proceed.
line 11870-->  CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
line 11871-->  ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes
line 11872-->    the ground.
line 11873-->  CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
line 11874-->    unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.
line 11875-->  ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
line 11876-->  CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out
line 11877-->    of tune.
line 11878-->  ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
line 11879-->    Sweet, say on.
line 11880-->  CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
line 11881-->
line 11882-->                   Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES  
line 11883-->
line 11884-->  ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
line 11885-->  JAQUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
line 11886-->    lief have been myself alone.
line 11887-->  ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
line 11888-->    for your society.
line 11889-->  JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
line 11890-->  ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
line 11891-->  JAQUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
line 11892-->    their barks.
line 11893-->  ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
line 11894-->    ill-favouredly.
line 11895-->  JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
line 11896-->  ORLANDO. Yes, just.
line 11897-->  JAQUES. I do not like her name.
line 11898-->  ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
line 11899-->    christen'd.
line 11900-->  JAQUES. What stature is she of?
line 11901-->  ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.
line 11902-->  JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been  
line 11903-->    acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?
line 11904-->  ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
line 11905-->    you have studied your questions.
line 11906-->  JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
line 11907-->    heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against
line 11908-->    our mistress the world, and all our misery.
line 11909-->  ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
line 11910-->    whom I know most faults.
line 11911-->  JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
line 11912-->  ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
line 11913-->    weary of you.
line 11914-->  JAQUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
line 11915-->  ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
line 11916-->    him.
line 11917-->  JAQUES. There I shall see mine own figure.
line 11918-->  ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
line 11919-->  JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
line 11920-->  ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
line 11921-->    Melancholy.
line 11922-->                                                     Exit JAQUES  
line 11923-->  ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
line 11924-->    and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,
line 11925-->    forester?
line 11926-->  ORLANDO. Very well; what would you?
line 11927-->  ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
line 11928-->  ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
line 11929-->    the forest.
line 11930-->  ROSALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
line 11931-->    every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
line 11932-->    of Time as well as a clock.
line 11933-->  ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
line 11934-->    proper?
line 11935-->  ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
line 11936-->    divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time
line 11937-->    trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still
line 11938-->    withal.
line 11939-->  ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
line 11940-->  ROSALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
line 11941-->    contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the
line 11942-->    interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems  
line 11943-->    the length of seven year.
line 11944-->  ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
line 11945-->  ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
line 11946-->    not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,
line 11947-->    and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one
line 11948-->    lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other
line 11949-->    knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles
line 11950-->    withal.
line 11951-->  ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
line 11952-->  ROSALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
line 11953-->    as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
line 11954-->  ORLANDO. Who stays it still withal?
line 11955-->  ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
line 11956-->    and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.
line 11957-->  ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
line 11958-->  ROSALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
line 11959-->    the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
line 11960-->  ORLANDO. Are you native of this place?
line 11961-->  ROSALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
line 11962-->  ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in  
line 11963-->    so removed a dwelling.
line 11964-->  ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
line 11965-->    uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland
line 11966-->    man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.
line 11967-->    I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I
line 11968-->    am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he
line 11969-->    hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.
line 11970-->  ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
line 11971-->    to the charge of women?
line 11972-->  ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
line 11973-->    as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his
line 11974-->    fellow-fault came to match it.
line 11975-->  ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
line 11976-->  ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
line 11977-->    sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
line 11978-->    plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon
line 11979-->    hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the
line 11980-->    name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give
line 11981-->    him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
line 11982-->    upon him.  
line 11983-->  ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
line 11984-->    remedy.
line 11985-->  ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
line 11986-->    how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you
line 11987-->    are not prisoner.
line 11988-->  ORLANDO. What were his marks?
line 11989-->  ROSALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
line 11990-->    which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;
line 11991-->    a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,
line 11992-->    for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.
line 11993-->    Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your
line 11994-->    sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you
line 11995-->    demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you
line 11996-->    are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself
line 11997-->    than seeming the lover of any other.
line 11998-->  ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
line 11999-->  ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
line 12000-->    believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess
line 12001-->    she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give
line 12002-->    the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that  
line 12003-->    hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
line 12004-->  ORLANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
line 12005-->    am that he, that unfortunate he.
line 12006-->  ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
line 12007-->  ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
line 12008-->  ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
line 12009-->    well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
line 12010-->    they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
line 12011-->    ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing
line 12012-->    it by counsel.
line 12013-->  ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
line 12014-->  ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
line 12015-->    love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which
line 12016-->    time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,
line 12017-->    changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
line 12018-->    shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every
line 12019-->    passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and
line 12020-->    women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like
line 12021-->    him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now
line 12022-->    weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his  
line 12023-->    mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to
line 12024-->    forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
line 12025-->    merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take
line 12026-->    upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,
line 12027-->    that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
line 12028-->  ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
line 12029-->  ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
line 12030-->    come every day to my cote and woo me.
line 12031-->  ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
line 12032-->  ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
line 12033-->    you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?
line 12034-->  ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
line 12035-->  ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
line 12036-->    go?                                                   Exeunt
line 12037-->
line 12038-->
line 12039-->
line 12040-->
line 12041-->SCENE III.
line 12042-->The forest
line 12043-->
line 12044-->Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind
line 12045-->
line 12046-->  TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
line 12047-->    Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature
line 12048-->    content you?
line 12049-->  AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
line 12050-->  TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
line 12051-->    capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
line 12052-->  JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
line 12053-->    thatch'd house!
line 12054-->  TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
line 12055-->    good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it
line 12056-->    strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
line 12057-->    Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
line 12058-->  AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
line 12059-->    word? Is it a true thing?
line 12060-->  TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
line 12061-->    and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may
line 12062-->    be said as lovers they do feign.  
line 12063-->  AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
line 12064-->  TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
line 12065-->    now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst
line 12066-->    feign.
line 12067-->  AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?
line 12068-->  TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
line 12069-->    coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
line 12070-->  JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!
line 12071-->  AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
line 12072-->    honest.
line 12073-->  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
line 12074-->    to put good meat into an unclean dish.
line 12075-->  AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
line 12076-->  TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
line 12077-->    sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will
line 12078-->    marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,
line 12079-->    the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in
line 12080-->    this place of the forest, and to couple us.
line 12081-->  JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
line 12082-->  AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!  
line 12083-->  TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
line 12084-->    in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
line 12085-->    assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are
line 12086-->    odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
line 12087-->    of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
line 12088-->    of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
line 12089-->    own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
line 12090-->    deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
line 12091-->    blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
line 12092-->    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
line 12093-->    brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
line 12094-->    skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes
line 12095-->    Sir Oliver.
line 12096-->
line 12097-->                       Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
line 12098-->
line 12099-->    Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here
line 12100-->    under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
line 12101-->  MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?
line 12102-->  TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.  
line 12103-->  MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
line 12104-->  JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
line 12105-->  TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
line 12106-->    You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am
line 12107-->    very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be
line 12108-->    cover'd.
line 12109-->  JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?
line 12110-->  TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
line 12111-->    the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons
line 12112-->    bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
line 12113-->  JAQUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
line 12114-->    under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good
line 12115-->    priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but
line 12116-->    join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
line 12117-->    prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.
line 12118-->  TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
line 12119-->    married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me
line 12120-->    well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me
line 12121-->    hereafter to leave my wife.
line 12122-->  JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.  
line 12123-->  TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;
line 12124-->    We must be married or we must live in bawdry.
line 12125-->    Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-
line 12126-->               O sweet Oliver,
line 12127-->               O brave Oliver,
line 12128-->           Leave me not behind thee.
line 12129-->    But-
line 12130-->                 Wind away,
line 12131-->               Begone, I say,
line 12132-->           I will not to wedding with thee.
line 12133-->                           Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY
line 12134-->  MARTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
line 12135-->    shall flout me out of my calling.                       Exit
line 12136-->

line 12139-->
line 12140-->SCENE IV.
line 12141-->The forest
line 12142-->
line 12143-->Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
line 12144-->
line 12145-->  ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
line 12146-->  CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
line 12147-->    do not become a man.
line 12148-->  ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
line 12149-->  CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
line 12150-->  ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
line 12151-->  CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.
line 12152-->    Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.
line 12153-->  ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
line 12154-->  CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
line 12155-->  ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
line 12156-->    holy bread.
line 12157-->  CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
line 12158-->    winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of
line 12159-->    chastity is in them.
line 12160-->  ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
line 12161-->    comes not?
line 12162-->  CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.  
line 12163-->  ROSALIND. Do you think so?
line 12164-->  CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
line 12165-->    for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered
line 12166-->    goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
line 12167-->  ROSALIND. Not true in love?
line 12168-->  CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
line 12169-->  ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
line 12170-->  CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
line 12171-->    stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer
line 12172-->    of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke,
line 12173-->    your father.
line 12174-->  ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
line 12175-->    He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as
line 12176-->    he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
line 12177-->    there is such a man as Orlando?
line 12178-->  CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
line 12179-->    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite
line 12180-->    traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
line 12181-->    spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
line 12182-->    goose. But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who  
line 12183-->    comes here?
line 12184-->
line 12185-->                         Enter CORIN
line 12186-->
line 12187-->  CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
line 12188-->    After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
line 12189-->    Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
line 12190-->    Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
line 12191-->    That was his mistress.
line 12192-->  CELIA. Well, and what of him?
line 12193-->  CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd
line 12194-->    Between the pale complexion of true love
line 12195-->    And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
line 12196-->    Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,
line 12197-->    If you will mark it.
line 12198-->  ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!
line 12199-->    The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
line 12200-->    Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
line 12201-->    I'll prove a busy actor in their play.                Exeunt
line 12202-->
line 12203-->
line 12204-->
line 12205-->
line 12206-->SCENE V.
line 12207-->Another part of the forest
line 12208-->
line 12209-->Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
line 12210-->
line 12211-->  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
line 12212-->    Say that you love me not; but say not so
line 12213-->    In bitterness. The common executioner,
line 12214-->    Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
line 12215-->    Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
line 12216-->    But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
line 12217-->    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
line 12218-->
line 12219-->          Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance
line 12220-->
line 12221-->  PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner;
line 12222-->    I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
line 12223-->    Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.
line 12224-->    'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
line 12225-->    That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
line 12226-->    Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
line 12227-->    Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!  
line 12228-->    Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
line 12229-->    And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
line 12230-->    Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
line 12231-->    Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
line 12232-->    Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
line 12233-->    Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
line 12234-->    Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
line 12235-->    Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,
line 12236-->    The cicatrice and capable impressure
line 12237-->    Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
line 12238-->    Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
line 12239-->    Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes
line 12240-->    That can do hurt.
line 12241-->  SILVIUS. O dear Phebe,
line 12242-->    If ever- as that ever may be near-
line 12243-->    You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
line 12244-->    Then shall you know the wounds invisible
line 12245-->    That love's keen arrows make.
line 12246-->  PHEBE. But till that time
line 12247-->    Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,  
line 12248-->    Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
line 12249-->    As till that time I shall not pity thee.
line 12250-->  ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
line 12251-->      mother,
line 12252-->    That you insult, exult, and all at once,
line 12253-->    Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-
line 12254-->    As, by my faith, I see no more in you
line 12255-->    Than without candle may go dark to bed-
line 12256-->    Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
line 12257-->    Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
line 12258-->    I see no more in you than in the ordinary
line 12259-->    Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
line 12260-->    I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
line 12261-->    No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;
line 12262-->    'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
line 12263-->    Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
line 12264-->    That can entame my spirits to your worship.
line 12265-->    You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
line 12266-->    Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
line 12267-->    You are a thousand times a properer man  
line 12268-->    Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you
line 12269-->    That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.
line 12270-->    'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
line 12271-->    And out of you she sees herself more proper
line 12272-->    Than any of her lineaments can show her.
line 12273-->    But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,
line 12274-->    And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
line 12275-->    For I must tell you friendly in your ear:
line 12276-->    Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
line 12277-->    Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
line 12278-->    Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
line 12279-->    So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
line 12280-->  PHEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
line 12281-->    I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
line 12282-->  ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
line 12283-->    in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee
line 12284-->    with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look
line 12285-->    you so upon me?
line 12286-->  PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.
line 12287-->  ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,  
line 12288-->    For I am falser than vows made in wine;
line 12289-->    Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
line 12290-->    'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
line 12291-->    Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
line 12292-->    Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
line 12293-->    And be not proud; though all the world could see,
line 12294-->    None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
line 12295-->    Come, to our flock.        Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN
line 12296-->  PHEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
line 12297-->    'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'
line 12298-->  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
line 12299-->  PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
line 12300-->  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
line 12301-->  PHEBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
line 12302-->  SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
line 12303-->    If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
line 12304-->    By giving love, your sorrow and my grief
line 12305-->    Were both extermin'd.
line 12306-->  PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
line 12307-->  SILVIUS. I would have you.  
line 12308-->  PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.
line 12309-->    Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
line 12310-->    And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
line 12311-->    But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
line 12312-->    Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
line 12313-->    I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.
line 12314-->    But do not look for further recompense
line 12315-->    Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
line 12316-->  SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
line 12317-->    And I in such a poverty of grace,
line 12318-->    That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
line 12319-->    To glean the broken ears after the man
line 12320-->    That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then
line 12321-->    A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
line 12322-->  PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
line 12323-->  SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
line 12324-->    And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
line 12325-->    That the old carlot once was master of.
line 12326-->  PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
line 12327-->    'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.  
line 12328-->    But what care I for words? Yet words do well
line 12329-->    When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
line 12330-->    It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;
line 12331-->    But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.
line 12332-->    He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him
line 12333-->    Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
line 12334-->    Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
line 12335-->    He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
line 12336-->    His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
line 12337-->    There was a pretty redness in his lip,
line 12338-->    A little riper and more lusty red
line 12339-->    Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
line 12340-->    Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
line 12341-->    There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
line 12342-->    In parcels as I did, would have gone near
line 12343-->    To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
line 12344-->    I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
line 12345-->    I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
line 12346-->    For what had he to do to chide at me?
line 12347-->    He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,  
line 12348-->    And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
line 12349-->    I marvel why I answer'd not again;
line 12350-->    But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
line 12351-->    I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
line 12352-->    And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
line 12353-->  SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
line 12354-->  PHEBE. I'll write it straight;
line 12355-->    The matter's in my head and in my heart;
line 12356-->    I will be bitter with him and passing short.
line 12357-->    Go with me, Silvius.                                  Exeunt

line 12373-->ACT IV. SCENE I.
line 12374-->The forest
line 12375-->
line 12376-->Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
line 12377-->
line 12378-->  JAQUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
line 12379-->    thee.
line 12380-->  ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
line 12381-->  JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
line 12382-->  ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
line 12383-->    fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
line 12384-->    drunkards.
line 12385-->  JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
line 12386-->  ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
line 12387-->  JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
line 12388-->    emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the
line 12389-->    courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is
line 12390-->    ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,
line 12391-->    which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a
line 12392-->    melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
line 12393-->    from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my
line 12394-->    travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous  
line 12395-->    sadness.
line 12396-->  ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
line 12397-->    sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then
line 12398-->    to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
line 12399-->    poor hands.
line 12400-->  JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
line 12401-->
line 12402-->                        Enter ORLANDO
line 12403-->
line 12404-->  ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
line 12405-->    fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
line 12406-->    travel for it too.
line 12407-->  ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
line 12408-->  JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
line 12409-->  ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
line 12410-->    strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
line 12411-->    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
line 12412-->    you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
line 12413-->    swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
line 12414-->    have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such  
line 12415-->    another trick, never come in my sight more.
line 12416-->  ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
line 12417-->  ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
line 12418-->    minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the
line 12419-->    thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said
line 12420-->    of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll
line 12421-->    warrant him heart-whole.
line 12422-->  ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
line 12423-->  ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
line 12424-->    as lief be woo'd of a snail.
line 12425-->  ORLANDO. Of a snail!
line 12426-->  ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
line 12427-->    his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make
line 12428-->    a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
line 12429-->  ORLANDO. What's that?
line 12430-->  ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
line 12431-->    your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents
line 12432-->    the slander of his wife.
line 12433-->  ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
line 12434-->  ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.  
line 12435-->  CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
line 12436-->    better leer than you.
line 12437-->  ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
line 12438-->    and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I
line 12439-->    were your very very Rosalind?
line 12440-->  ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
line 12441-->  ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
line 12442-->    gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
line 12443-->    Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
line 12444-->    lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to
line 12445-->    kiss.
line 12446-->  ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
line 12447-->  ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
line 12448-->    matter.
line 12449-->  ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
line 12450-->  ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
line 12451-->    should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
line 12452-->  ORLANDO. What, of my suit?
line 12453-->  ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
line 12454-->    Am not I your Rosalind?  
line 12455-->  ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
line 12456-->    of her.
line 12457-->  ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
line 12458-->  ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
line 12459-->  ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
line 12460-->    thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man
line 12461-->    died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had
line 12462-->    his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
line 12463-->    could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
line 12464-->    Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had
line 12465-->    turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,
line 12466-->    good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,
line 12467-->    being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish
line 12468-->    chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these
line 12469-->    are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
line 12470-->    eaten them, but not for love.
line 12471-->  ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
line 12472-->    protest, her frown might kill me.
line 12473-->  ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
line 12474-->    will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me  
line 12475-->    what you will, I will grant it.
line 12476-->  ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
line 12477-->  ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
line 12478-->  ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?
line 12479-->  ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
line 12480-->  ORLANDO. What sayest thou?
line 12481-->  ROSALIND. Are you not good?
line 12482-->  ORLANDO. I hope so.
line 12483-->  ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
line 12484-->    sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,
line 12485-->    Orlando. What do you say, sister?
line 12486-->  ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
line 12487-->  CELIA. I cannot say the words.
line 12488-->  ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
line 12489-->  CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
line 12490-->  ORLANDO. I will.
line 12491-->  ROSALIND. Ay, but when?
line 12492-->  ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
line 12493-->  ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
line 12494-->  ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.  
line 12495-->  ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
line 12496-->    Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;
line 12497-->    and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
line 12498-->  ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
line 12499-->  ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
line 12500-->    possess'd her.
line 12501-->  ORLANDO. For ever and a day.
line 12502-->  ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
line 12503-->    April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when
line 12504-->    they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will
line 12505-->    be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
line 12506-->    more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than
line 12507-->    an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for
line 12508-->    nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you
line 12509-->    are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when
line 12510-->    thou are inclin'd to sleep.
line 12511-->  ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
line 12512-->  ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
line 12513-->  ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.
line 12514-->  ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,  
line 12515-->    the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out
line 12516-->    at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop
line 12517-->    that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
line 12518-->  ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
line 12519-->    whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your
line 12520-->    wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
line 12521-->  ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
line 12522-->  ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
line 12523-->    take her without her answer, unless you take her without her
line 12524-->    tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
line 12525-->    occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will
line 12526-->    breed it like a fool!
line 12527-->  ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
line 12528-->  ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
line 12529-->  ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
line 12530-->    with thee again.
line 12531-->  ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
line 12532-->    prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That
line 12533-->    flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and  
line 12534-->    so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
line 12535-->  ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
line 12536-->  ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
line 12537-->    by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot
line 12538-->    of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
line 12539-->    think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow
line 12540-->    lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may
line 12541-->    be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore
line 12542-->    beware my censure, and keep your promise.
line 12543-->  ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
line 12544-->    Rosalind; so, adieu.
line 12545-->  ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
line 12546-->    offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO
line 12547-->  CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
line 12548-->    have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the
line 12549-->    world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
line 12550-->  ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
line 12551-->    know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;
line 12552-->    my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
line 12553-->  CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection  
line 12554-->    in, it runs out.
line 12555-->  ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
line 12556-->    thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind
line 12557-->    rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are
line 12558-->    out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,
line 12559-->    Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a
line 12560-->    shadow, and sigh till he come.
line 12561-->  CELIA. And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt

line 12567-->The forest
line 12568-->
line 12569-->        Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters
line 12570-->
line 12571-->  JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?
line 12572-->  LORD. Sir, it was I.
line 12573-->  JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
line 12574-->    it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a
line 12575-->    branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
line 12576-->  LORD. Yes, sir.
line 12577-->  JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
line 12578-->    enough.
line 12579-->
line 12580-->                    SONG.
line 12581-->
line 12582-->      What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
line 12583-->      His leather skin and horns to wear.
line 12584-->                              [The rest shall hear this burden:]
line 12585-->           Then sing him home.
line 12586-->
line 12587-->      Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;  
line 12588-->      It was a crest ere thou wast born.
line 12589-->           Thy father's father wore it;
line 12590-->           And thy father bore it.
line 12591-->      The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,
line 12592-->      Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.                   Exeunt

line 12597-->SCENE III.
line 12598-->The forest
line 12599-->
line 12600-->Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
line 12601-->
line 12602-->  ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
line 12603-->    And here much Orlando!
line 12604-->  CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
line 12605-->    ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who
line 12606-->    comes here.
line 12607-->
line 12608-->                      Enter SILVIUS
line 12609-->
line 12610-->  SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
line 12611-->    My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
line 12612-->    I know not the contents; but, as I guess
line 12613-->    By the stern brow and waspish action
line 12614-->    Which she did use as she was writing of it,
line 12615-->    It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,
line 12616-->    I am but as a guiltless messenger.
line 12617-->  ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
line 12618-->    And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
line 12619-->    She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;  
line 12620-->    She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
line 12621-->    Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
line 12622-->    Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
line 12623-->    Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
line 12624-->    This is a letter of your own device.
line 12625-->  SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
line 12626-->    Phebe did write it.
line 12627-->  ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
line 12628-->    And turn'd into the extremity of love.
line 12629-->    I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
line 12630-->    A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
line 12631-->    That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;
line 12632-->    She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.
line 12633-->    I say she never did invent this letter:
line 12634-->    This is a man's invention, and his hand.
line 12635-->  SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
line 12636-->  ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
line 12637-->    A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
line 12638-->    Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
line 12639-->    Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,  
line 12640-->    Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
line 12641-->    Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
line 12642-->  SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
line 12643-->    Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
line 12644-->  ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
line 12645-->                                                         [Reads]
line 12646-->
line 12647-->            'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
line 12648-->            That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'
line 12649-->
line 12650-->    Can a woman rail thus?
line 12651-->  SILVIUS. Call you this railing?
line 12652-->  ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
line 12653-->             Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'
line 12654-->
line 12655-->    Did you ever hear such railing?
line 12656-->
line 12657-->            'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
line 12658-->            That could do no vengeance to me.'
line 12659-->  
line 12660-->    Meaning me a beast.
line 12661-->
line 12662-->            'If the scorn of your bright eyne
line 12663-->            Have power to raise such love in mine,
line 12664-->            Alack, in me what strange effect
line 12665-->            Would they work in mild aspect!
line 12666-->            Whiles you chid me, I did love;
line 12667-->            How then might your prayers move!
line 12668-->            He that brings this love to the
line 12669-->            Little knows this love in me;
line 12670-->            And by him seal up thy mind,
line 12671-->            Whether that thy youth and kind
line 12672-->            Will the faithful offer take
line 12673-->            Of me and all that I can make;
line 12674-->            Or else by him my love deny,
line 12675-->            And then I'll study how to die.'
line 12676-->  SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?
line 12677-->  CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
line 12678-->  ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
line 12679-->    such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false  
line 12680-->    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
line 12681-->    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
line 12682-->    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
line 12683-->    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
line 12684-->    true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
line 12685-->                                                    Exit SILVIUS
line 12686-->
line 12687-->                         Enter OLIVER
line 12688-->
line 12689-->  OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
line 12690-->    Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
line 12691-->    A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
line 12692-->  CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
line 12693-->    The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
line 12694-->    Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
line 12695-->    But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
line 12696-->    There's none within.
line 12697-->  OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
line 12698-->    Then should I know you by description-
line 12699-->    Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,  
line 12700-->    Of female favour, and bestows himself
line 12701-->    Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
line 12702-->    And browner than her brother.' Are not you
line 12703-->    The owner of the house I did inquire for?
line 12704-->  CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
line 12705-->  OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
line 12706-->    And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
line 12707-->    He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
line 12708-->  ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
line 12709-->  OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
line 12710-->    What man I am, and how, and why, and where,
line 12711-->    This handkercher was stain'd.
line 12712-->  CELIA. I pray you, tell it.
line 12713-->  OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
line 12714-->    He left a promise to return again
line 12715-->    Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
line 12716-->    Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
line 12717-->    Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
line 12718-->    And mark what object did present itself.
line 12719-->    Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,  
line 12720-->    And high top bald with dry antiquity,
line 12721-->    A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
line 12722-->    Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
line 12723-->    A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
line 12724-->    Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
line 12725-->    The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
line 12726-->    Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
line 12727-->    And with indented glides did slip away
line 12728-->    Into a bush; under which bush's shade
line 12729-->    A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
line 12730-->    Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
line 12731-->    When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
line 12732-->    The royal disposition of that beast
line 12733-->    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
line 12734-->    This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
line 12735-->    And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
line 12736-->  CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
line 12737-->    And he did render him the most unnatural
line 12738-->    That liv'd amongst men.
line 12739-->  OLIVER. And well he might so do,  
line 12740-->    For well I know he was unnatural.
line 12741-->  ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
line 12742-->    Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
line 12743-->  OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
line 12744-->    But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
line 12745-->    And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
line 12746-->    Made him give battle to the lioness,
line 12747-->    Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
line 12748-->    From miserable slumber I awak'd.
line 12749-->  CELIA. Are you his brother?
line 12750-->  ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
line 12751-->  CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
line 12752-->  OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
line 12753-->    To tell you what I was, since my conversion
line 12754-->    So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
line 12755-->  ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
line 12756-->  OLIVER. By and by.
line 12757-->    When from the first to last, betwixt us two,
line 12758-->    Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
line 12759-->    As how I came into that desert place-  
line 12760-->    In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
line 12761-->    Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
line 12762-->    Committing me unto my brother's love;
line 12763-->    Who led me instantly unto his cave,
line 12764-->    There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
line 12765-->    The lioness had torn some flesh away,
line 12766-->    Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
line 12767-->    And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
line 12768-->    Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,
line 12769-->    And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
line 12770-->    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
line 12771-->    To tell this story, that you might excuse
line 12772-->    His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
line 12773-->    Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
line 12774-->    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
line 12775-->                                               [ROSALIND swoons]
line 12776-->  CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
line 12777-->  OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
line 12778-->  CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
line 12779-->  OLIVER. Look, he recovers.  
line 12780-->  ROSALIND. I would I were at home.
line 12781-->  CELIA. We'll lead you thither.
line 12782-->    I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
line 12783-->  OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
line 12784-->    You lack a man's heart.
line 12785-->  ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
line 12786-->    this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how
line 12787-->    well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
line 12788-->  OLIVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
line 12789-->    your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
line 12790-->  ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
line 12791-->  OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
line 12792-->  ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
line 12793-->    right.
line 12794-->  CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
line 12795-->    Good sir, go with us.
line 12796-->  OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back
line 12797-->    How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
line 12798-->  ROSALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
line 12799-->    counterfeiting to him. Will you go?                   Exeunt

line 12815-->ACT V. SCENE I.
line 12816-->The forest
line 12817-->
line 12818-->Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
line 12819-->
line 12820-->  TOUCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
line 12821-->  AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
line 12822-->    gentleman's saying.
line 12823-->  TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
line 12824-->    But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to
line 12825-->    you.
line 12826-->  AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
line 12827-->    world; here comes the man you mean.
line 12828-->
line 12829-->                         Enter WILLIAM
line 12830-->
line 12831-->  TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,
line 12832-->    we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be
line 12833-->    flouting; we cannot hold.
line 12834-->  WILLIAM. Good ev'n, Audrey.
line 12835-->  AUDREY. God ye good ev'n, William.
line 12836-->  WILLIAM. And good ev'n to you, sir.  
line 12837-->  TOUCHSTONE. Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
line 12838-->    head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?
line 12839-->  WILLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.
line 12840-->  TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
line 12841-->  WILLIAM. William, sir.
line 12842-->  TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
line 12843-->  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
line 12844-->  TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
line 12845-->    Art rich?
line 12846-->  WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
line 12847-->  TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
line 12848-->    yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
line 12849-->  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
line 12850-->  TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The
line 12851-->    fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be
line 12852-->    a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a
line 12853-->    grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning
line 12854-->    thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do
line 12855-->    love this maid?
line 12856-->  WILLIAM. I do, sir.  
line 12857-->  TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
line 12858-->  WILLIAM. No, sir.
line 12859-->  TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
line 12860-->    figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a
line 12861-->    glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your
line 12862-->    writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I
line 12863-->    am he.
line 12864-->  WILLIAM. Which he, sir?
line 12865-->  TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
line 12866-->    clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which
line 12867-->    in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is
line 12868-->    woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,
line 12869-->    clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
line 12870-->    or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
line 12871-->    death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,
line 12872-->    or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;
line 12873-->    will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and
line 12874-->    fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
line 12875-->  AUDREY. Do, good William.
line 12876-->  WILLIAM. God rest you merry, sir.                         Exit  
line 12877-->
line 12878-->                          Enter CORIN
line 12879-->
line 12880-->  CORIN. Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.
line 12881-->  TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.
line 12882-->                                                          Exeunt

line 12885-->
line 12886-->
line 12887-->SCENE II.
line 12888-->The forest
line 12889-->
line 12890-->Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER
line 12891-->
line 12892-->  ORLANDO. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should
line 12893-->    like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo?
line 12894-->    and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy
line 12895-->    her?
line 12896-->  OLIVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty
line 12897-->    of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden
line 12898-->    consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she
line 12899-->    loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It
line 12900-->    shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue
line 12901-->    that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live
line 12902-->    and die a shepherd.
line 12903-->  ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
line 12904-->    Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers. Go
line 12905-->    you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.
line 12906-->
line 12907-->                        Enter ROSALIND
line 12908-->  
line 12909-->  ROSALIND. God save you, brother.
line 12910-->  OLIVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit
line 12911-->  ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
line 12912-->    thy heart in a scarf!
line 12913-->  ORLANDO. It is my arm.
line 12914-->  ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
line 12915-->    lion.
line 12916-->  ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
line 12917-->  ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
line 12918-->    when he show'd me your handkercher?
line 12919-->  ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
line 12920-->  ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
line 12921-->    any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's
line 12922-->    thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother
line 12923-->    and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but
line 12924-->    they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but
line 12925-->    they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but
line 12926-->    they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair
line 12927-->    of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else
line 12928-->    be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of  
line 12929-->    love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
line 12930-->  ORLANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
line 12931-->    to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into
line 12932-->    happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I
line 12933-->    to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I
line 12934-->    shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
line 12935-->  ROSALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
line 12936-->    Rosalind?
line 12937-->  ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
line 12938-->  ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know
line 12939-->    of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are
line 12940-->    a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should
line 12941-->    bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you
line 12942-->    are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some
line 12943-->    little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and
line 12944-->    not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do
line 12945-->    strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd
line 12946-->    with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
line 12947-->    If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
line 12948-->    it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I  
line 12949-->    know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
line 12950-->    impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set
line 12951-->    her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any
line 12952-->    danger.
line 12953-->  ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
line 12954-->  ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I
line 12955-->    am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your
line 12956-->    friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to
line 12957-->    Rosalind, if you will.
line 12958-->
line 12959-->                     Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
line 12960-->
line 12961-->    Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
line 12962-->  PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
line 12963-->    To show the letter that I writ to you.
line 12964-->  ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
line 12965-->    To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
line 12966-->    You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;
line 12967-->    Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
line 12968-->  PHEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.  
line 12969-->  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
line 12970-->    And so am I for Phebe.
line 12971-->  PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
line 12972-->  ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
line 12973-->  ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
line 12974-->  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service;
line 12975-->    And so am I for Phebe.
line 12976-->  PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
line 12977-->  ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
line 12978-->  ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
line 12979-->  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
line 12980-->    All made of passion, and all made of wishes;
line 12981-->    All adoration, duty, and observance,
line 12982-->    All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,
line 12983-->    All purity, all trial, all obedience;
line 12984-->    And so am I for Phebe.
line 12985-->  PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
line 12986-->  ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
line 12987-->  ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman.
line 12988-->  PHEBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?  
line 12989-->  SILVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
line 12990-->  ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
line 12991-->  ROSALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
line 12992-->  ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
line 12993-->  ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
line 12994-->    wolves against the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can.
line 12995-->    [To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all
line 12996-->    together. [ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry woman,
line 12997-->    and I'll be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if
line 12998-->    ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To
line 12999-->    Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you, and
line 13000-->    you shall be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] As you love
line 13001-->    Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I
line 13002-->    love no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you
line 13003-->    commands.
line 13004-->  SILVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.
line 13005-->  PHEBE. Nor I.
line 13006-->  ORLANDO. Nor I.                                         Exeunt

line 13009-->
line 13010-->
line 13011-->SCENE III.
line 13012-->The forest
line 13013-->
line 13014-->Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
line 13015-->
line 13016-->  TOUCHSTONE. To-morrow is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-morrow will we
line 13017-->    be married.
line 13018-->  AUDREY. I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no
line 13019-->    dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come
line 13020-->    two of the banish'd Duke's pages.
line 13021-->
line 13022-->                            Enter two PAGES
line 13023-->
line 13024-->  FIRST PAGE. Well met, honest gentleman.
line 13025-->  TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
line 13026-->  SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
line 13027-->  FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or
line 13028-->    spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues
line 13029-->    to a bad voice?
line 13030-->  SECOND PAGE. I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies
line 13031-->    on a horse.
line 13032-->  
line 13033-->                      SONG.
line 13034-->        It was a lover and his lass,
line 13035-->          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
line 13036-->        That o'er the green corn-field did pass
line 13037-->          In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
line 13038-->        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
line 13039-->        Sweet lovers love the spring.
line 13040-->
line 13041-->        Between the acres of the rye,
line 13042-->          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
line 13043-->        These pretty country folks would lie,
line 13044-->          In the spring time, &c.
line 13045-->
line 13046-->        This carol they began that hour,
line 13047-->          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
line 13048-->        How that a life was but a flower,
line 13049-->          In the spring time, &c.
line 13050-->
line 13051-->        And therefore take the present time,
line 13052-->          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,  
line 13053-->        For love is crowned with the prime,
line 13054-->          In the spring time, &c.
line 13055-->
line 13056-->  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
line 13057-->    matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
line 13058-->  FIRST PAGE. YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our
line 13059-->    time.
line 13060-->  TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such
line 13061-->    a foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come,
line 13062-->    Audrey.                                               Exeunt

line 13065-->
line 13066-->
line 13067-->SCENE IV.
line 13068-->The forest
line 13069-->
line 13070-->Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA
line 13071-->
line 13072-->  DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
line 13073-->    Can do all this that he hath promised?
line 13074-->  ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
line 13075-->    As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
line 13076-->
line 13077-->               Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE
line 13078-->
line 13079-->  ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
line 13080-->    You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
line 13081-->    You will bestow her on Orlando here?
line 13082-->  DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
line 13083-->  ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
line 13084-->  ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
line 13085-->  ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
line 13086-->  PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
line 13087-->  ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,  
line 13088-->    You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
line 13089-->  PHEBE. So is the bargain.
line 13090-->  ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
line 13091-->  SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
line 13092-->  ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
line 13093-->    Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
line 13094-->    You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
line 13095-->    Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
line 13096-->    Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
line 13097-->    Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her
line 13098-->    If she refuse me; and from hence I go,
line 13099-->    To make these doubts all even.
line 13100-->                                       Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
line 13101-->  DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy
line 13102-->    Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
line 13103-->  ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
line 13104-->    Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
line 13105-->    But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
line 13106-->    And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
line 13107-->    Of many desperate studies by his uncle,  
line 13108-->    Whom he reports to be a great magician,
line 13109-->    Obscured in the circle of this forest.
line 13110-->
line 13111-->                    Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
line 13112-->
line 13113-->  JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
line 13114-->    coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
line 13115-->    in all tongues are call'd fools.
line 13116-->  TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!
line 13117-->  JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded
line 13118-->    gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a
line 13119-->     courtier, he swears.
line 13120-->  TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
line 13121-->    I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
line 13122-->    politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
line 13123-->    three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
line 13124-->    one.
line 13125-->  JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?
line 13126-->  TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
line 13127-->    seventh cause.  
line 13128-->  JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
line 13129-->  DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.
line 13130-->  TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
line 13131-->    here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear
line 13132-->    and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A
line 13133-->    poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
line 13134-->    poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich
line 13135-->    honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl
line 13136-->    in your foul oyster.
line 13137-->  DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
line 13138-->  TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
line 13139-->    diseases.
line 13140-->  JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
line 13141-->    the seventh cause?
line 13142-->  TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
line 13143-->    seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain
line 13144-->    courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not
line 13145-->    cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort
line 13146-->    Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
line 13147-->    send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip  
line 13148-->    Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.
line 13149-->    This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,
line 13150-->    he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof
line 13151-->    Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This
line 13152-->    is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie
line 13153-->    Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
line 13154-->  JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
line 13155-->  TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
line 13156-->    he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords
line 13157-->    and parted.
line 13158-->  JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
line 13159-->  TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
line 13160-->    books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,
line 13161-->    the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the
line 13162-->    Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
line 13163-->    Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;
line 13164-->    the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie
line 13165-->    Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven
line 13166-->    justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
line 13167-->    met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you  
line 13168-->    said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore
line 13169-->    brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.
line 13170-->  JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
line 13171-->    He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
line 13172-->  DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the
line 13173-->    presentation of that he shoots his wit:
line 13174-->
line 13175-->          Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC
line 13176-->
line 13177-->    HYMEN.    Then is there mirth in heaven,
line 13178-->              When earthly things made even
line 13179-->                Atone together.
line 13180-->              Good Duke, receive thy daughter;
line 13181-->              Hymen from heaven brought her,
line 13182-->                Yea, brought her hither,
line 13183-->              That thou mightst join her hand with his,
line 13184-->              Whose heart within his bosom is.
line 13185-->  ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
line 13186-->    [To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
line 13187-->  DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.  
line 13188-->  ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
line 13189-->  PHEBE. If sight and shape be true,
line 13190-->    Why then, my love adieu!
line 13191-->  ROSALIND. I'll have no father, if you be not he;
line 13192-->    I'll have no husband, if you be not he;
line 13193-->    Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
line 13194-->  HYMEN.    Peace, ho! I bar confusion;
line 13195-->            'Tis I must make conclusion
line 13196-->              Of these most strange events.
line 13197-->            Here's eight that must take hands
line 13198-->            To join in Hymen's bands,
line 13199-->              If truth holds true contents.
line 13200-->            You and you no cross shall part;
line 13201-->            You and you are heart in heart;
line 13202-->            You to his love must accord,
line 13203-->            Or have a woman to your lord;
line 13204-->            You and you are sure together,
line 13205-->            As the winter to foul weather.
line 13206-->            Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
line 13207-->            Feed yourselves with questioning,  
line 13208-->            That reason wonder may diminish,
line 13209-->            How thus we met, and these things finish.
line 13210-->
line 13211-->                       SONG
line 13212-->            Wedding is great Juno's crown;
line 13213-->              O blessed bond of board and bed!
line 13214-->            'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
line 13215-->              High wedlock then be honoured.
line 13216-->            Honour, high honour, and renown,
line 13217-->            To Hymen, god of every town!
line 13218-->
line 13219-->  DUKE SENIOR. O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
line 13220-->    Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
line 13221-->  PHEBE. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
line 13222-->    Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
line 13223-->
line 13224-->                 Enter JAQUES de BOYS
line 13225-->
line 13226-->  JAQUES de BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two.
line 13227-->    I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,  
line 13228-->    That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
line 13229-->    Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
line 13230-->    Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
line 13231-->    Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
line 13232-->    In his own conduct, purposely to take
line 13233-->    His brother here, and put him to the sword;
line 13234-->    And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
line 13235-->    Where, meeting with an old religious man,
line 13236-->    After some question with him, was converted
line 13237-->    Both from his enterprise and from the world;
line 13238-->    His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
line 13239-->    And all their lands restor'd to them again
line 13240-->    That were with him exil'd. This to be true
line 13241-->    I do engage my life.
line 13242-->  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man.
line 13243-->    Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
line 13244-->    To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,
line 13245-->    A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
line 13246-->    First, in this forest let us do those ends
line 13247-->    That here were well begun and well begot;  
line 13248-->    And after, every of this happy number,
line 13249-->    That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,
line 13250-->    Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
line 13251-->    According to the measure of their states.
line 13252-->    Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
line 13253-->    And fall into our rustic revelry.
line 13254-->    Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,
line 13255-->    With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.
line 13256-->  JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
line 13257-->    The Duke hath put on a religious life,
line 13258-->    And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
line 13259-->  JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.
line 13260-->  JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites
line 13261-->    There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
line 13262-->    [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;
line 13263-->    Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
line 13264-->    [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;
line 13265-->    [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies
line 13266-->    [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;
line 13267-->    [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage  
line 13268-->    Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;
line 13269-->    I am for other than for dancing measures.
line 13270-->  DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.
line 13271-->  JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have
line 13272-->    I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit
line 13273-->  DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites,
line 13274-->    As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.    [A dance] Exeunt
line 13275-->
line 13276-->EPILOGUE
line 13277-->                           EPILOGUE.
line 13278-->  ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but
line 13279-->    it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it
line 13280-->    be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play
line 13281-->    needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and
line 13282-->    good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a
line 13283-->    case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot
line 13284-->    insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
line 13285-->    furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My
line 13286-->    way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge
line 13287-->    you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of
line 13288-->    this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love
line 13289-->    you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you
line 13290-->    hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.
line 13291-->    If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that
line 13292-->    pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied
line 13293-->    not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,
line 13294-->    or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,
line 13295-->    bid me farewell.
line 13296-->

line 13367-->THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
line 13368-->
line 13369-->ACT I. SCENE 1
line 13370-->
line 13371-->A hall in the DUKE'S palace
line 13372-->
line 13373-->Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchant
line 13374-->of Syracuse, GAOLER, OFFICERS, and other ATTENDANTS
line 13375-->
line 13376-->AEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
line 13377-->  And by the doom of death end woes and all.
line 13378-->DUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
line 13379-->  I am not partial to infringe our laws.
line 13380-->  The enmity and discord which of late
line 13381-->  Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
line 13382-->  To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
line 13383-->  Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
line 13384-->  Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
line 13385-->  Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
line 13386-->  For, since the mortal and intestine jars
line 13387-->  'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
line 13388-->  It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
line 13389-->  Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
line 13390-->  To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
line 13391-->  Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus
line 13392-->  Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
line 13393-->  Again, if any Syracusian born
line 13394-->  Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,
line 13395-->  His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose,
line 13396-->  Unless a thousand marks be levied,
line 13397-->  To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
line 13398-->  Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
line 13399-->  Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
line 13400-->  Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die.
line 13401-->AEGEON. Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
line 13402-->  My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
line 13403-->DUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
line 13404-->  Why thou departed'st from thy native home,
line 13405-->  And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
line 13406-->AEGEON. A heavier task could not have been impos'd
line 13407-->  Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
line 13408-->  Yet, that the world may witness that my end
line 13409-->  Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
line 13410-->  I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
line 13411-->  In Syracuse was I born, and wed
line 13412-->  Unto a woman, happy but for me,
line 13413-->  And by me, had not our hap been bad.
line 13414-->  With her I liv'd in joy; our wealth increas'd
line 13415-->  By prosperous voyages I often made
line 13416-->  To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
line 13417-->  And the great care of goods at random left,
line 13418-->  Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
line 13419-->  From whom my absence was not six months old,
line 13420-->  Before herself, almost at fainting under
line 13421-->  The pleasing punishment that women bear,
line 13422-->  Had made provision for her following me,
line 13423-->  And soon and safe arrived where I was.
line 13424-->  There had she not been long but she became
line 13425-->  A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
line 13426-->  And, which was strange, the one so like the other
line 13427-->  As could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
line 13428-->  That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
line 13429-->  A mean woman was delivered
line 13430-->  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
line 13431-->  Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
line 13432-->  I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.
line 13433-->  My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
line 13434-->  Made daily motions for our home return;
line 13435-->  Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon
line 13436-->  We came aboard.
line 13437-->  A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
line 13438-->  Before the always-wind-obeying deep
line 13439-->  Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
line 13440-->  But longer did we not retain much hope,
line 13441-->  For what obscured light the heavens did grant
line 13442-->  Did but convey unto our fearful minds
line 13443-->  A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
line 13444-->  Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,
line 13445-->  Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
line 13446-->  Weeping before for what she saw must come,
line 13447-->  And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
line 13448-->  That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
line 13449-->  Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.
line 13450-->  And this it was, for other means was none:
line 13451-->  The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
line 13452-->  And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
line 13453-->  My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
line 13454-->  Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast,
line 13455-->  Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;
line 13456-->  To him one of the other twins was bound,
line 13457-->  Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
line 13458-->  The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
line 13459-->  Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
line 13460-->  Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,
line 13461-->  And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
line 13462-->  Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
line 13463-->  At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
line 13464-->  Dispers'd those vapours that offended us;
line 13465-->  And, by the benefit of his wished light,
line 13466-->  The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
line 13467-->  Two ships from far making amain to us-
line 13468-->  Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
line 13469-->  But ere they came-O, let me say no more!
line 13470-->  Gather the sequel by that went before.
line 13471-->DUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;
line 13472-->  For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
line 13473-->AEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now
line 13474-->  Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
line 13475-->  For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
line 13476-->  We were encount'red by a mighty rock,
line 13477-->  Which being violently borne upon,
line 13478-->  Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
line 13479-->  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
line 13480-->  Fortune had left to both of us alike
line 13481-->  What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
line 13482-->  Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened
line 13483-->  With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
line 13484-->  Was carried with more speed before the wind;
line 13485-->  And in our sight they three were taken up
line 13486-->  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
line 13487-->  At length another ship had seiz'd on us;
line 13488-->  And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
line 13489-->  Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests,
line 13490-->  And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
line 13491-->  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
line 13492-->  And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
line 13493-->  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,
line 13494-->  That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
line 13495-->  To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
line 13496-->DUKE. And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
line 13497-->  Do me the favour to dilate at full
line 13498-->  What have befall'n of them and thee till now.
line 13499-->AEGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
line 13500-->  At eighteen years became inquisitive
line 13501-->  After his brother, and importun'd me
line 13502-->  That his attendant-so his case was like,
line 13503-->  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-
line 13504-->  Might bear him company in the quest of him;
line 13505-->  Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,
line 13506-->  I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd.
line 13507-->  Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
line 13508-->  Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
line 13509-->  And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
line 13510-->  Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
line 13511-->  Or that or any place that harbours men.
line 13512-->  But here must end the story of my life;
line 13513-->  And happy were I in my timely death,
line 13514-->  Could all my travels warrant me they live.
line 13515-->DUKE. Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd
line 13516-->  To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
line 13517-->  Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
line 13518-->  Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
line 13519-->  Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
line 13520-->  My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
line 13521-->  But though thou art adjudged to the death,
line 13522-->  And passed sentence may not be recall'd
line 13523-->  But to our honour's great disparagement,
line 13524-->  Yet will I favour thee in what I can.
line 13525-->  Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
line 13526-->  To seek thy help by beneficial hap.
line 13527-->  Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
line 13528-->  Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
line 13529-->  And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
line 13530-->  Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
line 13531-->GAOLER. I will, my lord.
line 13532-->AEGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,
line 13533-->  But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

line 13537-->SCENE 2
line 13538-->
line 13539-->The mart
line 13540-->
line 13541-->Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and FIRST MERCHANT
line 13542-->
line 13543-->FIRST MERCHANT. Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,
line 13544-->  Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
line 13545-->  This very day a Syracusian merchant
line 13546-->  Is apprehended for arrival here;
line 13547-->  And, not being able to buy out his life,
line 13548-->  According to the statute of the town,
line 13549-->  Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
line 13550-->  There is your money that I had to keep.
line 13551-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
line 13552-->  And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
line 13553-->  Within this hour it will be dinner-time;
line 13554-->  Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
line 13555-->  Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
line 13556-->  And then return and sleep within mine inn;
line 13557-->  For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
line 13558-->  Get thee away.
line 13559-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man would take you at your word,
line 13560-->  And go indeed, having so good a mean.
line 13561--><Exit
line 13562-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
line 13563-->  When I am dull with care and melancholy,
line 13564-->  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
line 13565-->  What, will you walk with me about the town,
line 13566-->  And then go to my inn and dine with me?
line 13567-->FIRST MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
line 13568-->  Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
line 13569-->  I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
line 13570-->  Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,
line 13571-->  And afterward consort you till bed time.
line 13572-->  My present business calls me from you now.
line 13573-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
line 13574-->  And wander up and down to view the city.
line 13575-->FIRST MERCHANT. Sir, I commend you to your own content.
line 13576--><Exit FIRST MERCHANT
line 13577-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
line 13578-->  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
line 13579-->  I to the world am like a drop of water
line 13580-->  That in the ocean seeks another drop,
line 13581-->  Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
line 13582-->  Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.
line 13583-->  So I, to find a mother and a brother,
line 13584-->  In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
line 13585-->
line 13586-->Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
line 13587-->
line 13588-->  Here comes the almanac of my true date.
line 13589-->  What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?
line 13590-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late.
line 13591-->  The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;
line 13592-->  The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell-
line 13593-->  My mistress made it one upon my cheek;
line 13594-->  She is so hot because the meat is cold,
line 13595-->  The meat is cold because you come not home,
line 13596-->  You come not home because you have no stomach,
line 13597-->  You have no stomach, having broke your fast;
line 13598-->  But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,
line 13599-->  Are penitent for your default to-day.
line 13600-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
line 13601-->  Where have you left the money that I gave you?
line 13602-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last
line 13603-->  To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
line 13604-->  The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
line 13605-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
line 13606-->  Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
line 13607-->  We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
line 13608-->  So great a charge from thine own custody?
line 13609-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
line 13610-->  I from my mistress come to you in post;
line 13611-->  If I return, I shall be post indeed,
line 13612-->  For she will score your fault upon my pate.
line 13613-->  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
line 13614-->  And strike you home without a messenger.
line 13615-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
line 13616-->  Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
line 13617-->  Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
line 13618-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.
line 13619-->  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
line 13620-->  And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
line 13621-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
line 13622-->  Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.
line 13623-->  My mistress and her sister stays for you.
line 13624-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
line 13625-->  In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
line 13626-->  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
line 13627-->  That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd.
line 13628-->  Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
line 13629-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
line 13630-->  Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
line 13631-->  But not a thousand marks between you both.
line 13632-->  If I should pay your worship those again,
line 13633-->  Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
line 13634-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
line 13635-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
line 13636-->  She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
line 13637-->  And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
line 13638-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
line 13639-->  Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
line 13640-->[Beats him]
line 13641-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your hands!
line 13642-->  Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
line 13643--><Exit
line 13644-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
line 13645-->  The villain is o'erraught of all my money.
line 13646-->  They say this town is full of cozenage;
line 13647-->  As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
line 13648-->  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
line 13649-->  Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
line 13650-->  Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
line 13651-->  And many such-like liberties of sin;
line 13652-->  If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
line 13653-->  I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.
line 13654-->  I greatly fear my money is not safe.

line 13671-->ACT Il. SCENE 1
line 13672-->
line 13673-->The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
line 13674-->
line 13675-->Enter ADRIANA, wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, with LUCIANA, her sister
line 13676-->
line 13677-->ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
line 13678-->  That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
line 13679-->  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
line 13680-->LUCIANA. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
line 13681-->  And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;
line 13682-->  Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.
line 13683-->  A man is master of his liberty;
line 13684-->  Time is their master, and when they see time,
line 13685-->  They'll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.
line 13686-->ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?
line 13687-->LUCIANA. Because their business still lies out o' door.
line 13688-->ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
line 13689-->LUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your will.
line 13690-->ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.
line 13691-->LUCIANA. Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
line 13692-->  There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
line 13693-->  But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.
line 13694-->  The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
line 13695-->  Are their males' subjects, and at their controls.
line 13696-->  Man, more divine, the master of all these,
line 13697-->  Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas,
line 13698-->  Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,
line 13699-->  Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
line 13700-->  Are masters to their females, and their lords;
line 13701-->  Then let your will attend on their accords.
line 13702-->ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
line 13703-->LUCIANA. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
line 13704-->ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
line 13705-->LUCIANA. Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
line 13706-->ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?
line 13707-->LUCIANA. Till he come home again, I would forbear.
line 13708-->ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:
line 13709-->  They can be meek that have no other cause.
line 13710-->  A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
line 13711-->  We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
line 13712-->  But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain,
line 13713-->  As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
line 13714-->  So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
line 13715-->  With urging helpless patience would relieve me;
line 13716-->  But if thou live to see like right bereft,
line 13717-->  This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
line 13718-->LUCIANA. Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
line 13719-->  Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.
line 13720-->
line 13721-->Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
line 13722-->
line 13723-->ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
line 13724-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two
line 13725-->  ears can witness.
line 13726-->ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?
line 13727-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
line 13728-->  Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
line 13729-->LUCIANA. Spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning?
line 13730-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he struck so plainly I could to
line 13731-->  well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could
line 13732-->  scarce understand them.
line 13733-->ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
line 13734-->  It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
line 13735-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
line 13736-->ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!
line 13737-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad;
line 13738-->  But, sure, he is stark mad.
line 13739-->  When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,
line 13740-->  He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
line 13741-->  "Tis dinner time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
line 13742-->  'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
line 13743-->  'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
line 13744-->  'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
line 13745-->  'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
line 13746-->  'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress;
line 13747-->  I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress.'
line 13748-->LUCIANA. Quoth who?
line 13749-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master.
line 13750-->  'I know' quoth he 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
line 13751-->  So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
line 13752-->  I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
line 13753-->  For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
line 13754-->ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
line 13755-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back again, and be new beaten home?
line 13756-->  For God's sake, send some other messenger.
line 13757-->ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
line 13758-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will bless that cross with other beating;
line 13759-->  Between you I shall have a holy head.
line 13760-->ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.
line 13761-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so round with you, as you with me,
line 13762-->  That like a football you do spurn me thus?
line 13763-->  You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither;
line 13764-->  If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
line 13765--><Exit
line 13766-->LUCIANA. Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!
line 13767-->ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,
line 13768-->  Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
line 13769-->  Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took
line 13770-->  From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.
line 13771-->  Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?
line 13772-->  If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
line 13773-->  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.
line 13774-->  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
line 13775-->  That's not my fault; he's master of my state.
line 13776-->  What ruins are in me that can be found
line 13777-->  By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
line 13778-->  Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
line 13779-->  A sunny look of his would soon repair.
line 13780-->  But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
line 13781-->  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
line 13782-->LUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.
line 13783-->ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
line 13784-->  I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;
line 13785-->  Or else what lets it but he would be here?
line 13786-->  Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain;
line 13787-->  Would that alone a love he would detain,
line 13788-->  So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
line 13789-->  I see the jewel best enamelled
line 13790-->  Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still
line 13791-->  That others touch and, often touching, will
line 13792-->  Where gold; and no man that hath a name
line 13793-->  By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
line 13794-->  Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
line 13795-->  I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
line 13796-->LUCIANA. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
line 13797--><Exeunt

line 13799-->
line 13800-->SCENE 2
line 13801-->
line 13802-->The mart
line 13803-->
line 13804-->Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
line 13805-->
line 13806-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
line 13807-->  Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
line 13808-->  Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
line 13809-->  By computation and mine host's report
line 13810-->  I could not speak with Dromio since at first
line 13811-->  I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
line 13812-->
line 13813-->Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
line 13814-->
line 13815-->  How now, sir, is your merry humour alter'd?
line 13816-->  As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
line 13817-->  You know no Centaur! You receiv'd no gold!
line 13818-->  Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!
line 13819-->  My house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
line 13820-->  That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
line 13821-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?
line 13822-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
line 13823-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I did not see you since you sent me hence,
line 13824-->  Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
line 13825-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
line 13826-->  And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
line 13827-->  For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.
line 13828-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
line 13829-->  What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
line 13830-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
line 13831-->  Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
line 13832-->[Beating him]
line 13833-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God's sake! Now your jest is earnest.
line 13834-->  Upon what bargain do you give it me?
line 13835-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
line 13836-->  Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
line 13837-->  Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
line 13838-->  And make a common of my serious hours.
line 13839-->  When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
line 13840-->  But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
line 13841-->  If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
line 13842-->  And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
line 13843-->  Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
line 13844-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, call you it? So you would
line 13845-->  leave battering, I had rather have it a head. An you use
line 13846-->  these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and
line 13847-->  insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
line 13848-->  But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?
line 13849-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
line 13850-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
line 13851-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
line 13852-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say
line 13853-->  every why hath a wherefore.
line 13854-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
line 13855-->  For urging it the second time to me.
line 13856-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
line 13857-->  When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?
line 13858-->  Well, sir, I thank you.
line 13859-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
line 13860-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, for this something that you gave
line 13861-->  me for nothing.
line 13862-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
line 13863-->  give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinnertime?
line 13864-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
line 13865-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
line 13866-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.
line 13867-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
line 13868-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.
line 13869-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
line 13870-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me
line 13871-->  another dry basting.
line 13872-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
line 13873-->  there's a time for all things.
line 13874-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have denied that, before you
line 13875-->  were so choleric.
line 13876-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
line 13877-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the
line 13878-->  plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
line 13879-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
line 13880-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There's no time for a man to recover
line 13881-->  his hair that grows bald by nature.
line 13882-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
line 13883-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and
line 13884-->  recover the lost hair of another man.
line 13885-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
line 13886-->  hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
line 13887-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a blessing that he bestows
line 13888-->  on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
line 13889-->  given them in wit.
line 13890-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
line 13891-->  hath more hair than wit.
line 13892-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the
line 13893-->  wit to lose his hair.
line 13894-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
line 13895-->  men plain dealers without wit.
line 13896-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost;
line 13897-->  yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
line 13898-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
line 13899-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and sound ones too.
line 13900-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
line 13901-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.
line 13902-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
line 13903-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.
line 13904-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
line 13905-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in
line 13906-->  tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his
line 13907-->  porridge.
line 13908-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
line 13909-->  is no time for all things.
line 13910-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
line 13911-->  hair lost by nature.
line 13912-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
line 13913-->  there is no time to recover.
line 13914-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,
line 13915-->  and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.
line 13916-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
line 13917-->  soft, who wafts us yonder?
line 13918-->
line 13919-->Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
line 13920-->
line 13921-->ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
line 13922-->  Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
line 13923-->  I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
line 13924-->  The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
line 13925-->  That never words were music to thine ear,
line 13926-->  That never object pleasing in thine eye,
line 13927-->  That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
line 13928-->  That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
line 13929-->  Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
line 13930-->  How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
line 13931-->  That thou art then estranged from thyself?
line 13932-->  Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
line 13933-->  That, undividable, incorporate,
line 13934-->  Am better than thy dear self's better part.
line 13935-->  Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;
line 13936-->  For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
line 13937-->  A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
line 13938-->  And take unmingled thence that drop again
line 13939-->  Without addition or diminishing,
line 13940-->  As take from me thyself, and not me too.
line 13941-->  How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
line 13942-->  Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,
line 13943-->  And that this body, consecrate to thee,
line 13944-->  By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
line 13945-->  Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
line 13946-->  And hurl the name of husband in my face,
line 13947-->  And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
line 13948-->  And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
line 13949-->  And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
line 13950-->  I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.
line 13951-->  I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
line 13952-->  My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
line 13953-->  For if we two be one, and thou play false,
line 13954-->  I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
line 13955-->  Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
line 13956-->  Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
line 13957-->  I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.
line 13958-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
line 13959-->  In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
line 13960-->  As strange unto your town as to your talk,
line 13961-->  Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
line 13962-->  Wants wit in all one word to understand.
line 13963-->LUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang'd with you!
line 13964-->  When were you wont to use my sister thus?
line 13965-->  She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
line 13966-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
line 13967-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?
line 13968-->ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him-
line 13969-->  That he did buffet thee, and in his blows
line 13970-->  Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
line 13971-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
line 13972-->  What is the course and drift of your compact?
line 13973-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, Sir? I never saw her till this time.
line 13974-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
line 13975-->  Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
line 13976-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I never spake with her in all my life.
line 13977-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
line 13978-->  Unless it be by inspiration?
line 13979-->ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity
line 13980-->  To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
line 13981-->  Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
line 13982-->  Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
line 13983-->  But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
line 13984-->  Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
line 13985-->  Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
line 13986-->  Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
line 13987-->  Makes me with thy strength to communicate.
line 13988-->  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
line 13989-->  Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
line 13990-->  Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion
line 13991-->  Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.
line 13992-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
line 13993-->  What, was I married to her in my dream?
line 13994-->  Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
line 13995-->  What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
line 13996-->  Until I know this sure uncertainty,
line 13997-->  I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
line 13998-->LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
line 13999-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cross me for sinner.
line 14000-->  This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!
line 14001-->  We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
line 14002-->  If we obey them not, this will ensue:
line 14003-->  They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
line 14004-->LUCIANA. Why prat'st thou to thyself, and answer'st not?
line 14005-->  Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
line 14006-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am not I?
line 14007-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
line 14008-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
line 14009-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
line 14010-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.
line 14011-->LUCIANA. If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass.
line 14012-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass.
line 14013-->  'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
line 14014-->  But I should know her as well as she knows me.
line 14015-->ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
line 14016-->  To put the finger in the eye and weep,
line 14017-->  Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.
line 14018-->  Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
line 14019-->  Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,
line 14020-->  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
line 14021-->  Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
line 14022-->  Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
line 14023-->  Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
line 14024-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
line 14025-->  Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis'd?
line 14026-->  Known unto these, and to myself disguis'd!
line 14027-->  I'll say as they say, and persever so,
line 14028-->  And in this mist at all adventures go.
line 14029-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
line 14030-->ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
line 14031-->LUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

line 14048-->ACT III. SCENE 1
line 14049-->
line 14050-->Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
line 14051-->
line 14052-->Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR
line 14053-->
line 14054-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
line 14055-->  My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
line 14056-->  Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
line 14057-->  To see the making of her carcanet,
line 14058-->  And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
line 14059-->  But here's a villain that would face me down
line 14060-->  He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
line 14061-->  And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
line 14062-->  And that I did deny my wife and house.
line 14063-->  Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
line 14064-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
line 14065-->  That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;
line 14066-->  If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
line 14067-->  Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
line 14068-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
line 14069-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Marry, so it doth appear
line 14070-->  By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
line 14071-->  I should kick, being kick'd; and being at that pass,
line 14072-->  You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.
line 14073-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
line 14074-->  May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
line 14075-->BALTHAZAR. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
line 14076-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
line 14077-->  A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
line 14078-->BALTHAZAR. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
line 14079-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
line 14080-->  but words.
line 14081-->BALTHAZAR. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
line 14082-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
line 14083-->  But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
line 14084-->  Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
line 14085-->  But, soft, my door is lock'd; go bid them let us in.
line 14086-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!
line 14087-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!
line 14088-->  Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
line 14089-->  Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,
line 14090-->  When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.
line 14091-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What patch is made our porter?
line 14092-->  My master stays in the street.
line 14093-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Let him walk from whence he came,
line 14094-->    lest he catch cold on's feet.
line 14095-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
line 14096-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when,
line 14097-->    an you'll tell me wherefore.
line 14098-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
line 14099-->    I have not din'd to-day.
line 14100-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Nor to-day here you must not;
line 14101-->    come again when you may.
line 14102-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
line 14103-->    from the house I owe?
line 14104-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  The porter for this time,
line 14105-->    sir, and my name is Dromio.
line 14106-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Villain, thou hast stol'n both mine
line 14107-->    office and my name!
line 14108-->  The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
line 14109-->  If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
line 14110-->  Thou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.
line 14111-->
line 14112-->Enter LUCE, within
line 14113-->
line 14114-->LUCE.  [Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate?
line 14115-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Let my master in, Luce.
line 14116-->LUCE.  [Within]  Faith, no, he comes too late;
line 14117-->  And so tell your master.
line 14118-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Lord, I must laugh!
line 14119-->  Have at you with a proverb: Shall I set in my staff?
line 14120-->LUCE.  [Within]  Have at you with another: that's-when? can you tell?
line 14121-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  If thy name be called Luce
line 14122-->    -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
line 14123-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
line 14124-->LUCE.  [Within]  I thought to have ask'd you.
line 14125-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  And you said no.
line 14126-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. SO, Come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
line 14127-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
line 14128-->LUCE.  [Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?
line 14129-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, knock the door hard.
line 14130-->LUCE.  [Within]  Let him knock till it ache.
line 14131-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
line 14132-->LUCE.  [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
line 14133-->
line 14134-->Enter ADRIANA, within
line 14135-->
line 14136-->ADRIANA.  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise?
line 14137-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  By my troth, your town is
line 14138-->    troubled with unruly boys.
line 14139-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
line 14140-->    have come before.
line 14141-->ADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door.
line 14142-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. If YOU went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
line 14143-->ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
line 14144-->BALTHAZAR. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
line 14145-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
line 14146-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
line 14147-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
line 14148-->  Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold;
line 14149-->  It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
line 14150-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
line 14151-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Break any breaking here,
line 14152-->    and I'll break your knave's pate.
line 14153-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A man may break a word with you,
line 14154-->    sir; and words are but wind;
line 14155-->  Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
line 14156-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking;
line 14157-->    out upon thee, hind!
line 14158-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's too much 'out upon thee!' pray thee let me in.
line 14159-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Ay, when fowls have no
line 14160-->    feathers and fish have no fin.
line 14161-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
line 14162-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
line 14163-->  For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
line 14164-->  If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
line 14165-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
line 14166-->BALTHAZAR. Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
line 14167-->  Herein you war against your reputation,
line 14168-->  And draw within the compass of suspect
line 14169-->  Th' unviolated honour of your wife.
line 14170-->  Once this-your long experience of her wisdom,
line 14171-->  Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,
line 14172-->  Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
line 14173-->  And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
line 14174-->  Why at this time the doors are made against you.
line 14175-->  Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,
line 14176-->  And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
line 14177-->  And, about evening, come yourself alone
line 14178-->  To know the reason of this strange restraint.
line 14179-->  If by strong hand you offer to break in
line 14180-->  Now in the stirring passage of the day,
line 14181-->  A vulgar comment will be made of it,
line 14182-->  And that supposed by the common rout
line 14183-->  Against your yet ungalled estimation
line 14184-->  That may with foul intrusion enter in
line 14185-->  And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
line 14186-->  For slander lives upon succession,
line 14187-->  For ever hous'd where it gets possession.
line 14188-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
line 14189-->  And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.
line 14190-->  I know a wench of excellent discourse,
line 14191-->  Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;
line 14192-->  There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
line 14193-->  My wife-but, I protest, without desert-
line 14194-->  Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;
line 14195-->  To her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
line 14196-->  And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.
line 14197-->  Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
line 14198-->  For there's the house. That chain will I bestow-
line 14199-->  Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-
line 14200-->  Upon mine hostess there; good sir, make haste.
line 14201-->  Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
line 14202-->  I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
line 14203-->ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
line 14204-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.

line 14208-->SCENE 2
line 14209-->
line 14210-->Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
line 14211-->
line 14212-->Enter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
line 14213-->
line 14214-->LUCIANA. And may it be that you have quite forgot
line 14215-->  A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
line 14216-->  Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
line 14217-->  Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
line 14218-->  If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
line 14219-->  Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness;
line 14220-->  Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
line 14221-->  Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;
line 14222-->  Let not my sister read it in your eye;
line 14223-->  Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
line 14224-->  Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
line 14225-->  Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
line 14226-->  Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
line 14227-->  Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
line 14228-->  Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
line 14229-->  What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
line 14230-->  'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
line 14231-->  And let her read it in thy looks at board;
line 14232-->  Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
line 14233-->  Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.
line 14234-->  Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
line 14235-->  Being compact of credit, that you love us;
line 14236-->  Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
line 14237-->  We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
line 14238-->  Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
line 14239-->  Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.
line 14240-->  'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
line 14241-->  When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
line 14242-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
line 14243-->  Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine-
line 14244-->  Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
line 14245-->  Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine.
line 14246-->  Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
line 14247-->  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
line 14248-->  Smoth'red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
line 14249-->  The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
line 14250-->  Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
line 14251-->  To make it wander in an unknown field?
line 14252-->  Are you a god? Would you create me new?
line 14253-->  Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'll yield.
line 14254-->  But if that I am I, then well I know
line 14255-->  Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
line 14256-->  Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;
line 14257-->  Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
line 14258-->  O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
line 14259-->  To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
line 14260-->  Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;
line 14261-->  Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
line 14262-->  And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;
line 14263-->  And in that glorious supposition think
line 14264-->  He gains by death that hath such means to die.
line 14265-->  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.
line 14266-->LUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
line 14267-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
line 14268-->LUCIANA. It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
line 14269-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
line 14270-->LUCIANA. Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
line 14271-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
line 14272-->LUCIANA. Why call you me love? Call my sister so.
line 14273-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
line 14274-->LUCIANA. That's my sister.
line 14275-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
line 14276-->  It is thyself, mine own self's better part;
line 14277-->  Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
line 14278-->  My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
line 14279-->  My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
line 14280-->LUCIANA. All this my sister is, or else should be.
line 14281-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
line 14282-->  Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;
line 14283-->  Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.
line 14284-->  Give me thy hand.
line 14285-->LUCIANA. O, soft, sir, hold you still;
line 14286-->  I'll fetch my sister to get her good will.
line 14287--><Exit LUCIANA
line 14288-->
line 14289-->Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
line 14290-->
line 14291-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
line 14292-->  so fast?
line 14293-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio?
line 14294-->  Am I your man? Am I myself?
line 14295-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
line 14296-->  man, thou art thyself.
line 14297-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and besides
line 14298-->  myself.
line 14299-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
line 14300-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due
line 14301-->  to a woman-one that claims me, one that haunts me, one
line 14302-->  that will have me.
line 14303-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
line 14304-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, such claim as you would
line 14305-->  lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not
line 14306-->  that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
line 14307-->  being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
line 14308-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
line 14309-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A very reverent body; ay, such a one
line 14310-->  as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.'
line 14311-->  I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
line 14312-->  wondrous fat marriage.
line 14313-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
line 14314-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench,
line 14315-->  and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but
line 14316-->  to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
line 14317-->  I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn
line 14318-->  Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she'll burn
line 14319-->  week longer than the whole world.
line 14320-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
line 14321-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Swart, like my shoe; but her face
line 14322-->  nothing like so clean kept; for why, she sweats, a man may
line 14323-->  go over shoes in the grime of it.
line 14324-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
line 14325-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood
line 14326-->  could not do it.
line 14327-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
line 14328-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nell, sir; but her name and three
line 14329-->  quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure
line 14330-->  her from hip to hip.
line 14331-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
line 14332-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No longer from head to foot than
line 14333-->  from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find
line 14334-->  out countries in her.
line 14335-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
line 14336-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by
line 14337-->  the bogs.
line 14338-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
line 14339-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I found it by the barrenness, hard in
line 14340-->  the palm of the hand.
line 14341-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
line 14342-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. In her forehead, arm'd and reverted,
line 14343-->  making war against her heir.
line 14344-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
line 14345-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I look'd for the chalky cliffs, but I
line 14346-->  could find no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her
line 14347-->  chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
line 14348-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
line 14349-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in
line 14350-->  her breath.
line 14351-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
line 14352-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embellished with
line 14353-->  rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the
line 14354-->  hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be
line 14355-->  ballast at her nose.
line 14356-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
line 14357-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, Sir, I did not look so low. To
line 14358-->  conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me; call'd me
line 14359-->  Dromio; swore I was assur'd to her; told me what privy
line 14360-->  marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the
line 14361-->  mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I,
line 14362-->  amaz'd, ran from her as a witch.
line 14363-->  And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith,
line 14364-->    and my heart of steel,
line 14365-->  She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' wheel.
line 14366-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
line 14367-->  An if the wind blow any way from shore,
line 14368-->  I will not harbour in this town to-night.
line 14369-->  If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
line 14370-->  Where I will walk till thou return to me.
line 14371-->  If every one knows us, and we know none,
line 14372-->  'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
line 14373-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. As from a bear a man would run for life,
line 14374-->  So fly I from her that would be my wife.
line 14375--><Exit
line 14376-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
line 14377-->  And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
line 14378-->  She that doth call me husband, even my soul
line 14379-->  Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
line 14380-->  Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
line 14381-->  Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
line 14382-->  Hath almost made me traitor to myself;
line 14383-->  But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
line 14384-->  I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
line 14385-->
line 14386-->Enter ANGELO with the chain
line 14387-->
line 14388-->ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
line 14389-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
line 14390-->ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
line 14391-->  I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;
line 14392-->  The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
line 14393-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
line 14394-->ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
line 14395-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
line 14396-->ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
line 14397-->  Go home with it, and please your wife withal;
line 14398-->  And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
line 14399-->  And then receive my money for the chain.
line 14400-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
line 14401-->  For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
line 14402-->ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
line 14403--><Exit
line 14404-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
line 14405-->  But this I think, there's no man is so vain
line 14406-->  That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
line 14407-->  I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
line 14408-->  When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
line 14409-->  I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;
line 14410-->  If any ship put out, then straight away.

line 14427-->ACT IV. SCENE 1
line 14428-->
line 14429-->A public place
line 14430-->
line 14431-->Enter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OFFICER
line 14432-->
line 14433-->SECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
line 14434-->  And since I have not much importun'd you;
line 14435-->  Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
line 14436-->  To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
line 14437-->  Therefore make present satisfaction,
line 14438-->  Or I'll attach you by this officer.
line 14439-->ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
line 14440-->  Is growing to me by Antipholus;
line 14441-->  And in the instant that I met with you
line 14442-->  He had of me a chain; at five o'clock
line 14443-->  I shall receive the money for the same.
line 14444-->  Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
line 14445-->  I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.
line 14446-->
line 14447-->Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS, from the COURTEZAN'S
line 14448-->
line 14449-->OFFICER. That labour may you save; see where he comes.
line 14450-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
line 14451-->  And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow
line 14452-->  Among my wife and her confederates,
line 14453-->  For locking me out of my doors by day.
line 14454-->  But, soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
line 14455-->  Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
line 14456-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I buy a thousand pound a year; I buy a rope.
line 14457--><Exit DROMIO
line 14458-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
line 14459-->  I promised your presence and the chain;
line 14460-->  But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
line 14461-->  Belike you thought our love would last too long,
line 14462-->  If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
line 14463-->ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
line 14464-->  How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
line 14465-->  The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,
line 14466-->  Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
line 14467-->  Than I stand debted to this gentleman.
line 14468-->  I pray you see him presently discharg'd,
line 14469-->  For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.
line 14470-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
line 14471-->  Besides, I have some business in the town.
line 14472-->  Good signior, take the stranger to my house,
line 14473-->  And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
line 14474-->  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.
line 14475-->  Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
line 14476-->ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
line 14477-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
line 14478-->ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
line 14479-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
line 14480-->  Or else you may return without your money.
line 14481-->ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
line 14482-->  Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
line 14483-->  And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
line 14484-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
line 14485-->  Your breach of promise to the Porpentine;
line 14486-->  I should have chid you for not bringing it,
line 14487-->  But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
line 14488-->SECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
line 14489-->ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
line 14490-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
line 14491-->ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
line 14492-->  Either send the chain or send by me some token.
line 14493-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
line 14494-->  Come, where's the chain? I pray you let me see it.
line 14495-->SECOND MERCHANT. My business cannot brook this dalliance.
line 14496-->  Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no;
line 14497-->  If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
line 14498-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
line 14499-->ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
line 14500-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
line 14501-->ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
line 14502-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
line 14503-->ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
line 14504-->  Consider how it stands upon my credit.
line 14505-->SECOND MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
line 14506-->OFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me.
line 14507-->ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
line 14508-->  Either consent to pay this sum for me,
line 14509-->  Or I attach you by this officer.
line 14510-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
line 14511-->  Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st.
line 14512-->ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
line 14513-->  I would not spare my brother in this case,
line 14514-->  If he should scorn me so apparently.
line 14515-->OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.
line 14516-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
line 14517-->  But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
line 14518-->  As all the metal in your shop will answer.
line 14519-->ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
line 14520-->  To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
line 14521-->
line 14522-->Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bay
line 14523-->
line 14524-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there's a bark of Epidamnum
line 14525-->  That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
line 14526-->  And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
line 14527-->  I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
line 14528-->  The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx.
line 14529-->  The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
line 14530-->  Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at an
line 14531-->  But for their owner, master, and yourself.
line 14532-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
line 14533-->  What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
line 14534-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
line 14535-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
line 14536-->  And told thee to what purpose and what end.
line 14537-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. YOU sent me for a rope's end as soon-
line 14538-->  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
line 14539-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
line 14540-->  And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
line 14541-->  To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
line 14542-->  Give her this key, and tell her in the desk
line 14543-->  That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
line 14544-->  There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.
line 14545-->  Tell her I am arrested in the street,
line 14546-->  And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone.
line 14547-->  On, officer, to prison till it come.
line 14548--><Exeunt all but DROMIO
line 14549-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana! that is where we din'd,
line 14550-->  Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.
line 14551-->  She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
line 14552-->  Thither I must, although against my will,
line 14553-->  For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.
line 14554--><Exit
line 14555-->
line 14556-->
line 14557-->SCENE 2
line 14558-->
line 14559-->The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
line 14560-->
line 14561-->Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
line 14562-->
line 14563-->ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
line 14564-->  Might'st thou perceive austerely in his eye
line 14565-->  That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no?
line 14566-->  Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
line 14567-->  What observation mad'st thou in this case
line 14568-->  Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
line 14569-->LUCIANA. First he denied you had in him no right.
line 14570-->ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.
line 14571-->LUCIANA. Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
line 14572-->ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
line 14573-->LUCIANA. Then pleaded I for you.
line 14574-->ADRIANA. And what said he?
line 14575-->LUCIANA. That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
line 14576-->ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
line 14577-->LUCIANA. With words that in an honest suit might move.
line 14578-->  First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
line 14579-->ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?
line 14580-->LUCIANA. Have patience, I beseech.
line 14581-->ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;
line 14582-->  My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
line 14583-->  He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
line 14584-->  Ill-fac'd, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
line 14585-->  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
line 14586-->  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
line 14587-->LUCIANA. Who would be jealous then of such a one?
line 14588-->  No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
line 14589-->ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,
line 14590-->  And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
line 14591-->  Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;
line 14592-->  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
line 14593-->
line 14594-->Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
line 14595-->
line 14596-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the purse. Sweet
line 14597-->  now, make haste.
line 14598-->LUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy breath?
line 14599-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By running fast.
line 14600-->ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
line 14601-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
line 14602-->  A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
line 14603-->  One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
line 14604-->  A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
line 14605-->  A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
line 14606-->  A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
line 14607-->  The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;
line 14608-->  A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
line 14609-->  One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell.
line 14610-->ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?
line 14611-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter; he is rested on the case.
line 14612-->ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?
line 14613-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
line 14614-->  But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
line 14615-->  Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
line 14616-->ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I wonder at:
line 14617-->  Thus he unknown to me should be in debt.
line 14618-->  Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
line 14619-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. on a band, but on a stronger thing,
line 14620-->  A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
line 14621-->ADRIANA. What, the chain?
line 14622-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; 'tis time that I were gone.
line 14623-->  It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
line 14624-->ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.
line 14625-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes. If any hour meet a sergeant,
line 14626-->    'a turns back for very fear.
line 14627-->ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!
line 14628-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes
line 14629-->    more than he's worth to season.
line 14630-->  Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
line 14631-->  That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
line 14632-->  If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
line 14633-->  Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
line 14634-->
line 14635-->Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse
line 14636-->
line 14637-->ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,
line 14638-->  And bring thy master home immediately.
line 14639-->  Come, sister; I am press'd down with conceit-
line 14640-->  Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

line 14648-->Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
line 14649-->
line 14650-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
line 14651-->  As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
line 14652-->  And every one doth call me by my name.
line 14653-->  Some tender money to me, some invite me,
line 14654-->  Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,
line 14655-->  Some offer me commodities to buy;
line 14656-->  Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop,
line 14657-->  And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
line 14658-->  And therewithal took measure of my body.
line 14659-->  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,
line 14660-->  And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
line 14661-->
line 14662-->Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
line 14663-->
line 14664-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me
line 14665-->  for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell'd?
line 14666-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
line 14667-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise,
line 14668-->  but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the
line 14669-->  calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind
line 14670-->  you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.
line 14671-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
line 14672-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that
line 14673-->  went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
line 14674-->  that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest
line 14675-->  them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give
line 14676-->  them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more
line 14677-->  exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.
line 14678-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
line 14679-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;
line 14680-->  that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; on
line 14681-->  that thinks a man always going to bed, and says 'God give
line 14682-->  you good rest!'
line 14683-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
line 14684-->  there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone?
line 14685-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I brought you word an
line 14686-->  hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and
line 14687-->  then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to tarry for the
line 14688-->  boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.
line 14689-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
line 14690-->  And here we wander in illusions.
line 14691-->  Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
line 14692-->
line 14693-->Enter a COURTEZAN
line 14694-->
line 14695-->COURTEZAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
line 14696-->  I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.
line 14697-->  Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
line 14698-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
line 14699-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistress Satan?
line 14700-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
line 14701-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's
line 14702-->  dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and
line 14703-->  thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me!' That's
line 14704-->  as much to say 'God make me a light wench!' It is written
line 14705-->  they appear to men like angels of light; light is an effect
line 14706-->  of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn.
line 14707-->  Come not near her.
line 14708-->COURTEZAN. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
line 14709-->  Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here.
line 14710-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat,
line 14711-->  or bespeak a long spoon.
line 14712-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
line 14713-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, he must have a long spoon
line 14714-->  that must eat with the devil.
line 14715-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
line 14716-->  Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;
line 14717-->  I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
line 14718-->COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
line 14719-->  Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,
line 14720-->  And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
line 14721-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
line 14722-->  A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
line 14723-->  A nut, a cherry-stone;
line 14724-->  But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
line 14725-->  Master, be wise; an if you give it her,
line 14726-->  The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.
line 14727-->COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain;
line 14728-->  I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
line 14729-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
line 14730-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly pride' says the peacock. Mistress, that you know.
line 14731--><Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
line 14732-->COURTEZAN. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,
line 14733-->  Else would he never so demean himself.
line 14734-->  A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
line 14735-->  And for the same he promis'd me a chain;
line 14736-->  Both one and other he denies me now.
line 14737-->  The reason that I gather he is mad,
line 14738-->  Besides this present instance of his rage,
line 14739-->  Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
line 14740-->  Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
line 14741-->  Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
line 14742-->  On purpose shut the doors against his way.
line 14743-->  My way is now to hie home to his house,
line 14744-->  And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
line 14745-->  He rush'd into my house and took perforce
line 14746-->  My ring away. This course I fittest choose,
line 14747-->  For forty ducats is too much to lose.

line 14754-->
line 14755-->Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER
line 14756-->
line 14757-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
line 14758-->  I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
line 14759-->  To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
line 14760-->  My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
line 14761-->  And will not lightly trust the messenger.
line 14762-->  That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
line 14763-->  I tell you 'twill sound harshly in her cars.
line 14764-->
line 14765-->Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS, with a rope's-end
line 14766-->
line 14767-->  Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
line 14768-->  How now, sir! Have you that I sent you for?
line 14769-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
line 14770-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
line 14771-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
line 14772-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
line 14773-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
line 14774-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
line 14775-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I
line 14776-->  return'd.
line 14777-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
line 14778-->[Beating him]
line 14779-->OFFICER. Good sir, be patient.
line 14780-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in
line 14781-->  adversity.
line 14782-->OFFICER. Good now, hold thy tongue.
line 14783-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
line 14784-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
line 14785-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I would I were senseless, sir, that I
line 14786-->  might not feel your blows.
line 14787-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
line 14788-->  blows, and so is an ass.
line 14789-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I am an ass indeed; you may prove it
line 14790-->  by my long 'ears. I have served him from the hour of my
line 14791-->  nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for
line 14792-->  my service but blows. When I am cold he heats me with
line 14793-->  beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am
line 14794-->  wak'd with it when I sleep; rais'd with it when I sit; driven
line 14795-->  out of doors with it when I go from home; welcom'd home
line 14796-->  with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as
line 14797-->  beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam'd me,
line 14798-->  I shall beg with it from door to door.

line 14802-->
line 14803-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
line 14804-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
line 14805-->  rather, to prophesy like the parrot, 'Beware the rope's-end.'
line 14806-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
line 14807-->[Beating him]
line 14808-->COURTEZAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?
line 14809-->ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.
line 14810-->  Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer:
line 14811-->  Establish him in his true sense again,
line 14812-->  And I will please you what you will demand.
line 14813-->LUCIANA. Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
line 14814-->COURTEZAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
line 14815-->PINCH. Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
line 14816-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
line 14817-->[Striking him]
line 14818-->PINCH. I charge thee, Satan, hous'd within this man,
line 14819-->  To yield possession to my holy prayers,
line 14820-->  And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
line 14821-->  I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
line 14822-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
line 14823-->ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
line 14824-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
line 14825-->  Did this companion with the saffron face
line 14826-->  Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
line 14827-->  Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,
line 14828-->  And I denied to enter in my house?
line 14829-->ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home,
line 14830-->  Where would you had remain'd until this time,
line 14831-->  Free from these slanders and this open shame!
line 14832-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
line 14833-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, Sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
line 14834-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
line 14835-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
line 14836-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
line 14837-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she herself revil'd you there.
line 14838-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
line 14839-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
line 14840-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
line 14841-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My bones bear witness,
line 14842-->  That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
line 14843-->ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
line 14844-->PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,
line 14845-->  And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.
line 14846-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
line 14847-->ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
line 14848-->  By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
line 14849-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and goodwill you might,
line 14850-->  But surely, master, not a rag of money.
line 14851-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
line 14852-->ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
line 14853-->LUCIANA. And I am witness with her that she did.
line 14854-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness
line 14855-->  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
line 14856-->PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
line 14857-->  I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
line 14858-->  They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.
line 14859-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
line 14860-->  And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
line 14861-->ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
line 14862-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, gentle master, I receiv'd no gold;
line 14863-->  But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
line 14864-->ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
line 14865-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
line 14866-->  And art confederate with a damned pack
line 14867-->  To make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
line 14868-->  But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
line 14869-->  That would behold in me this shameful sport.
line 14870-->ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
line 14871-->PINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him.
line 14872-->
line 14873-->Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives
line 14874-->
line 14875-->LUCIANA. Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
line 14876-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
line 14877-->  I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them
line 14878-->  To make a rescue?
line 14879-->OFFICER. Masters, let him go;
line 14880-->  He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
line 14881-->PINCH. Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
line 14882-->[They bind DROMIO]
line 14883-->ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
line 14884-->  Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
line 14885-->  Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
line 14886-->OFFICER. He is my prisoner; if I let him go,
line 14887-->  The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.
line 14888-->ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
line 14889-->  Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
line 14890-->  And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
line 14891-->  Good Master Doctor, see him safe convey'd
line 14892-->  Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
line 14893-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
line 14894-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here ent'red in bond for you.
line 14895-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
line 14896-->  dost thou mad me?
line 14897-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Will you be bound for nothing?
line 14898-->  Be mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
line 14899-->LUCIANA. God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
line 14900-->ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
line 14901--><Exeunt all but ADRIANA, LUCIANA, OFFICERS, and COURTEZAN
line 14902-->  Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
line 14903-->OFFICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?
line 14904-->ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
line 14905-->OFFICER. Two hundred ducats.
line 14906-->ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?
line 14907-->OFFICER. Due for a chain your husband had of him.
line 14908-->ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
line 14909-->COURTEZAN. When as your husband, all in rage, to-day
line 14910-->  Came to my house, and took away my ring-
line 14911-->  The ring I saw upon his finger now-
line 14912-->  Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
line 14913-->ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.
line 14914-->  Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is;
line 14915-->  I long to know the truth hereof at large.

line 14929-->  I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
line 14930-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, stay here this night; they will
line 14931-->  surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us
line 14932-->  gold; methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
line 14933-->  the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me,
line 14934-->  could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch.

line 14953-->ACT V. SCENE 1
line 14954-->
line 14955-->A street before a priory
line 14956-->
line 14957-->Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO
line 14958-->
line 14959-->ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
line 14960-->  But I protest he had the chain of me,
line 14961-->  Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
line 14962-->SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem'd here in the city?
line 14963-->ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
line 14964-->  Of credit infinite, highly belov'd,
line 14965-->  Second to none that lives here in the city;
line 14966-->  His word might bear my wealth at any time.
line 14967-->SECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
line 14968-->
line 14969-->Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
line 14970-->
line 14971-->ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
line 14972-->  Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
line 14973-->  Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
line 14974-->  Signior Andpholus, I wonder much
line 14975-->  That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
line 14976-->  And, not without some scandal to yourself,
line 14977-->  With circumstance and oaths so to deny
line 14978-->  This chain, which now you wear so openly.
line 14979-->  Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
line 14980-->  You have done wrong to this my honest friend;
line 14981-->  Who, but for staying on our controversy,
line 14982-->  Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.
line 14983-->  This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
line 14984-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
line 14985-->SECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
line 14986-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
line 14987-->SECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
line 14988-->  Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st
line 14989-->  To walk where any honest men resort.
line 14990-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
line 14991-->  I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
line 14992-->  Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand.
line 14993-->SECOND MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
line 14994-->[They draw]
line 14995-->
line 14996-->Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERS
line 14997-->
line 14998-->ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.
line 14999-->  Some get within him, take his sword away;
line 15000-->  Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.
line 15001-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Run, master, run; for God's sake take a house.
line 15002-->  This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd.
line 15003--><Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory
line 15004-->
line 15005-->Enter the LADY ABBESS
line 15006-->
line 15007-->ABBESS. Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
line 15008-->ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
line 15009-->  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,
line 15010-->  And bear him home for his recovery.
line 15011-->ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
line 15012-->SECOND MERCHANT. I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
line 15013-->ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?
line 15014-->ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
line 15015-->  And much different from the man he was;
line 15016-->  But till this afternoon his passion
line 15017-->  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
line 15018-->ABBESS. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
line 15019-->  Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
line 15020-->  Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
line 15021-->  A sin prevailing much in youthful men
line 15022-->  Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
line 15023-->  Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
line 15024-->ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;
line 15025-->  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
line 15026-->ABBESS. You should for that have reprehended him.
line 15027-->ADRIANA. Why, so I did.
line 15028-->ABBESS. Ay, but not rough enough.
line 15029-->ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.
line 15030-->ABBESS. Haply in private.
line 15031-->ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.
line 15032-->ABBESS. Ay, but not enough.
line 15033-->ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.
line 15034-->  In bed, he slept not for my urging it;
line 15035-->  At board, he fed not for my urging it;
line 15036-->  Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
line 15037-->  In company, I often glanced it;
line 15038-->  Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
line 15039-->ABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad.
line 15040-->  The venom clamours of a jealous woman
line 15041-->  Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
line 15042-->  It seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
line 15043-->  And thereof comes it that his head is light.
line 15044-->  Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
line 15045-->  Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
line 15046-->  Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
line 15047-->  And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
line 15048-->  Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.
line 15049-->  Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
line 15050-->  But moody and dull melancholy,
line 15051-->  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
line 15052-->  And at her heels a huge infectious troop
line 15053-->  Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
line 15054-->  In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
line 15055-->  To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
line 15056-->  The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits
line 15057-->  Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.
line 15058-->LUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly,
line 15059-->  When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly.
line 15060-->  Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?
line 15061-->ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.
line 15062-->  Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.
line 15063-->ABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.
line 15064-->ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
line 15065-->ABBESS. Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,
line 15066-->  And it shall privilege him from your hands
line 15067-->  Till I have brought him to his wits again,
line 15068-->  Or lose my labour in assaying it.
line 15069-->ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
line 15070-->  Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
line 15071-->  And will have no attorney but myself;
line 15072-->  And therefore let me have him home with me.
line 15073-->ABBESS. Be patient; for I will not let him stir
line 15074-->  Till I have us'd the approved means I have,
line 15075-->  With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,
line 15076-->  To make of him a formal man again.
line 15077-->  It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
line 15078-->  A charitable duty of my order;
line 15079-->  Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.
line 15080-->ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;
line 15081-->  And ill it doth beseem your holiness
line 15082-->  To separate the husband and the wife.
line 15083-->ABBESS. Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.
line 15084--><Exit
line 15085-->LUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
line 15086-->ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
line 15087-->  And never rise until my tears and prayers
line 15088-->  Have won his Grace to come in person hither
line 15089-->  And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
line 15090-->SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five;
line 15091-->  Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
line 15092-->  Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
line 15093-->  The place of death and sorry execution,
line 15094-->  Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
line 15095-->ANGELO. Upon what cause?
line 15096-->SECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
line 15097-->  Who put unluckily into this bay
line 15098-->  Against the laws and statutes of this town,
line 15099-->  Beheaded publicly for his offence.
line 15100-->ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
line 15101-->LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.
line 15102-->
line 15103-->Enter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded;
line 15104-->with the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS
line 15105-->
line 15106-->DUKE. Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
line 15107-->  If any friend will pay the sum for him,
line 15108-->  He shall not die; so much we tender him.
line 15109-->ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!
line 15110-->DUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady;
line 15111-->  It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
line 15112-->ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
line 15113-->  Who I made lord of me and all I had
line 15114-->  At your important letters-this ill day
line 15115-->  A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
line 15116-->  That desp'rately he hurried through the street,
line 15117-->  With him his bondman all as mad as he,
line 15118-->  Doing displeasure to the citizens
line 15119-->  By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
line 15120-->  Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
line 15121-->  Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
line 15122-->  Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
line 15123-->  That here and there his fury had committed.
line 15124-->  Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
line 15125-->  He broke from those that had the guard of him,
line 15126-->  And with his mad attendant and himself,
line 15127-->  Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
line 15128-->  Met us again and, madly bent on us,
line 15129-->  Chas'd us away; till, raising of more aid,
line 15130-->  We came again to bind them. Then they fled
line 15131-->  Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
line 15132-->  And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,
line 15133-->  And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
line 15134-->  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
line 15135-->  Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command
line 15136-->  Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
line 15137-->DUKE. Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars,
line 15138-->  And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,
line 15139-->  When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
line 15140-->  To do him all the grace and good I could.
line 15141-->  Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,
line 15142-->  And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,
line 15143-->  I will determine this before I stir.
line 15144-->
line 15145-->Enter a MESSENGER
line 15146-->
line 15147-->MESSENGER. O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
line 15148-->  My master and his man are both broke loose,
line 15149-->  Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,
line 15150-->  Whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire;
line 15151-->  And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him
line 15152-->  Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.
line 15153-->  My master preaches patience to him, and the while
line 15154-->  His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;
line 15155-->  And sure, unless you send some present help,
line 15156-->  Between them they will kill the conjurer.
line 15157-->ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
line 15158-->  And that is false thou dost report to us.
line 15159-->MESSENGER. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
line 15160-->  I have not breath'd almost since I did see it.
line 15161-->  He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
line 15162-->  To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
line 15163-->[Cry within]
line 15164-->  Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!
line 15165-->DUKE. Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds.
line 15166-->ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you
line 15167-->  That he is borne about invisible.
line 15168-->  Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,
line 15169-->  And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
line 15170-->
line 15171-->Enter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUS
line 15172-->
line 15173-->ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
line 15174-->  Even for the service that long since I did thee,
line 15175-->  When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
line 15176-->  Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
line 15177-->  That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
line 15178-->AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
line 15179-->  I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.
line 15180-->ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
line 15181-->  She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
line 15182-->  That hath abused and dishonoured me
line 15183-->  Even in the strength and height of injury.
line 15184-->  Beyond imagination is the wrong
line 15185-->  That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
line 15186-->DUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
line 15187-->ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
line 15188-->  While she with harlots feasted in my house.
line 15189-->DUKE. A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?
line 15190-->ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,
line 15191-->  To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
line 15192-->  As this is false he burdens me withal!
line 15193-->LUCIANA. Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night
line 15194-->  But she tells to your Highness simple truth!
line 15195-->ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
line 15196-->  In this the madman justly chargeth them.
line 15197-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
line 15198-->  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
line 15199-->  Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
line 15200-->  Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
line 15201-->  This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;
line 15202-->  That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
line 15203-->  Could witness it, for he was with me then;
line 15204-->  Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
line 15205-->  Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
line 15206-->  Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
line 15207-->  Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
line 15208-->  I went to seek him. In the street I met him,
line 15209-->  And in his company that gentleman.
line 15210-->  There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
line 15211-->  That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,
line 15212-->  Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
line 15213-->  He did arrest me with an officer.
line 15214-->  I did obey, and sent my peasant home
line 15215-->  For certain ducats; he with none return'd.
line 15216-->  Then fairly I bespoke the officer
line 15217-->  To go in person with me to my house.
line 15218-->  By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
line 15219-->  Of vile confederates. Along with them
line 15220-->  They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,
line 15221-->  A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
line 15222-->  A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
line 15223-->  A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
line 15224-->  A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
line 15225-->  Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
line 15226-->  And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
line 15227-->  And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
line 15228-->  Cries out I was possess'd. Then all together
line 15229-->  They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
line 15230-->  And in a dark and dankish vault at home
line 15231-->  There left me and my man, both bound together;
line 15232-->  Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
line 15233-->  I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
line 15234-->  Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
line 15235-->  To give me ample satisfaction
line 15236-->  For these deep shames and great indignities.
line 15237-->ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
line 15238-->  That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.
line 15239-->DUKE. But had he such a chain of thee, or no?
line 15240-->ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
line 15241-->  These people saw the chain about his neck.
line 15242-->SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
line 15243-->  Heard you confess you had the chain of him,
line 15244-->  After you first forswore it on the mart;
line 15245-->  And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
line 15246-->  And then you fled into this abbey here,
line 15247-->  From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
line 15248-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
line 15249-->  Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;
line 15250-->  I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
line 15251-->  And this is false you burden me withal.
line 15252-->DUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
line 15253-->  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
line 15254-->  If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
line 15255-->  If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
line 15256-->  You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here
line 15257-->  Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
line 15258-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine.
line 15259-->COURTEZAN. He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
line 15260-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
line 15261-->DUKE. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
line 15262-->COURTEZAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
line 15263-->DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the Abbess hither.
line 15264-->  I think you are all mated or stark mad.
line 15265--><Exit one to the ABBESS
line 15266-->AEGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
line 15267-->  Haply I see a friend will save my life
line 15268-->  And pay the sum that may deliver me.
line 15269-->DUKE. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
line 15270-->AEGEON. Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
line 15271-->  And is not that your bondman Dromio?
line 15272-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
line 15273-->  But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords
line 15274-->  Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
line 15275-->AEGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.
line 15276-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
line 15277-->  For lately we were bound as you are now.
line 15278-->  You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
line 15279-->AEGEON. Why look you strange on me? You know me well.
line 15280-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
line 15281-->AEGEON. O! grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last;
line 15282-->  And careful hours with time's deformed hand
line 15283-->  Have written strange defeatures in my face.
line 15284-->  But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
line 15285-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
line 15286-->AEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?
line 15287-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, trust me, sir, nor I.
line 15288-->AEGEON. I am sure thou dost.
line 15289-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and
line 15290-->  whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
line 15291-->AEGEON. Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
line 15292-->  Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
line 15293-->  In seven short years that here my only son
line 15294-->  Knows not my feeble key of untun'd cares?
line 15295-->  Though now this grained face of mine be hid
line 15296-->  In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
line 15297-->  And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
line 15298-->  Yet hath my night of life some memory,
line 15299-->  My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
line 15300-->  My dull deaf ears a little use to hear;
line 15301-->  All these old witnesses-I cannot err-
line 15302-->  Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
line 15303-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
line 15304-->AEGEON. But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,
line 15305-->  Thou know'st we parted; but perhaps, my son,
line 15306-->  Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery.
line 15307-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
line 15308-->  the city Can witness with me that it is not so:
line 15309-->  I ne'er saw Syracuse in my life.
line 15310-->DUKE. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
line 15311-->  Have I been patron to Antipholus,
line 15312-->  During which time he ne'er saw Syracuse.
line 15313-->  I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
line 15314-->
line 15315-->Re-enter the ABBESS, with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
line 15316-->
line 15317-->ABBESS. Most mighty Duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
line 15318-->[All gather to see them]
line 15319-->ADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
line 15320-->DUKE. One of these men is genius to the other;
line 15321-->  And so of these. Which is the natural man,
line 15322-->  And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
line 15323-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.
line 15324-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I, Sir, am Dromio; pray let me stay.
line 15325-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
line 15326-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, my old master! who hath bound
line 15327-->ABBESS. Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,
line 15328-->  And gain a husband by his liberty.
line 15329-->  Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man
line 15330-->  That hadst a wife once call'd Aemilia,
line 15331-->  That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.
line 15332-->  O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,
line 15333-->  And speak unto the same Aemilia!
line 15334-->AEGEON. If I dream not, thou art Aemilia.
line 15335-->  If thou art she, tell me where is that son
line 15336-->  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
line 15337-->ABBESS. By men of Epidamnum he and I
line 15338-->  And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;
line 15339-->  But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
line 15340-->  By force took Dromio and my son from them,
line 15341-->  And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
line 15342-->  What then became of them I cannot tell;
line 15343-->  I to this fortune that you see me in.
line 15344-->DUKE. Why, here begins his morning story right.
line 15345-->  These two Antipholus', these two so like,
line 15346-->  And these two Dromios, one in semblance-
line 15347-->  Besides her urging of her wreck at sea-
line 15348-->  These are the parents to these children,
line 15349-->  Which accidentally are met together.
line 15350-->  Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?
line 15351-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
line 15352-->DUKE. Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
line 15353-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
line 15354-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And I with him.
line 15355-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
line 15356-->  Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
line 15357-->ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
line 15358-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
line 15359-->ADRIANA. And are not you my husband?
line 15360-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
line 15361-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
line 15362-->  And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
line 15363-->  Did call me brother.  [To LUCIANA]  What I told you then,
line 15364-->  I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
line 15365-->  If this be not a dream I see and hear.
line 15366-->ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
line 15367-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
line 15368-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
line 15369-->ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
line 15370-->ADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
line 15371-->  By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
line 15372-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, none by me.
line 15373-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
line 15374-->  And Dromio my man did bring them me.
line 15375-->  I see we still did meet each other's man,
line 15376-->  And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
line 15377-->  And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.
line 15378-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
line 15379-->DUKE. It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
line 15380-->COURTEZAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
line 15381-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
line 15382-->  good cheer.
line 15383-->ABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
line 15384-->  To go with us into the abbey here,
line 15385-->  And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
line 15386-->  And all that are assembled in this place
line 15387-->  That by this sympathized one day's error
line 15388-->  Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
line 15389-->  And we shall make full satisfaction.
line 15390-->  Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
line 15391-->  Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
line 15392-->  My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
line 15393-->  The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
line 15394-->  And you the calendars of their nativity,
line 15395-->  Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
line 15396-->  After so long grief, such nativity!
line 15397-->DUKE. With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
line 15398--><Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, ANTIPHOLUS OF
line 15399-->EPHESUS, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS
line 15400-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
line 15401-->ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
line 15402-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
line 15403-->ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.
line 15404-->  Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon.
line 15405-->  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
line 15406--><Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
line 15407-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There is a fat friend at your master's house,
line 15408-->  That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner;
line 15409-->  She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
line 15410-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother;
line 15411-->  I see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth.
line 15412-->  Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
line 15413-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not I, sir; you are my elder.
line 15414-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. That's a question; how shall we try it?
line 15415-->DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. We'll draw cuts for the senior; till then,
line 15416-->    lead thou first.
line 15417-->DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, then, thus:
line 15418-->  We came into the world like brother and brother,
line 15419-->  And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

line 15491-->
line 15492-->
line 15493-->
line 15494-->SCENE:
line 15495-->Rome and the neighbourhood; Corioli and the neighbourhood; Antium
line 15496-->
line 15497-->
line 15498-->
line 15499-->ACT I. SCENE I.
line 15500-->Rome. A street
line 15501-->
line 15502-->Enter a company of mutinous citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons
line 15503-->
line 15504-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
line 15505-->  ALL. Speak, speak.
line 15506-->  FIRST CITIZEN. YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish?
line 15507-->  ALL. Resolv'd, resolv'd.
line 15508-->  FIRST CITIZEN. First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the
line 15509-->    people.
line 15510-->  ALL. We know't, we know't.
line 15511-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own
line 15512-->    price. Is't a verdict?
line 15513-->  ALL. No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!
line 15514-->  SECOND CITIZEN. One word, good citizens.
line 15515-->  FIRST CITIZEN. We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
line 15516-->    What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield
line 15517-->    us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess
line 15518-->    they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The
line 15519-->    leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an  
line 15520-->    inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a
line 15521-->    gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
line 15522-->    rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
line 15523-->    thirst for revenge.
line 15524-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
line 15525-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Against him first; he's a very dog to the
line 15526-->    commonalty.
line 15527-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Consider you what services he has done for his
line 15528-->    country?
line 15529-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Very well, and could be content to give him good
line 15530-->    report for't but that he pays himself with being proud.
line 15531-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Nay, but speak not maliciously.
line 15532-->  FIRST CITIZEN. I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it
line 15533-->    to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it
line 15534-->    was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be
line 15535-->    partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.
line 15536-->  SECOND CITIZEN. What he cannot help in his nature you account a
line 15537-->    vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
line 15538-->  FIRST CITIZEN. If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
line 15539-->    he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.  [Shouts  
line 15540-->    within]  What shouts are these? The other side o' th' city is
line 15541-->    risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol!
line 15542-->  ALL. Come, come.
line 15543-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Soft! who comes here?
line 15544-->
line 15545-->                       Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA
line 15546-->
line 15547-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov'd
line 15548-->    the people.
line 15549-->  FIRST CITIZEN. He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so!
line 15550-->  MENENIUS. What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you
line 15551-->    With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.
line 15552-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Our business is not unknown to th' Senate; they have
line 15553-->    had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll
line 15554-->    show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths;
line 15555-->    they shall know we have strong arms too.
line 15556-->  MENENIUS. Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
line 15557-->    Will you undo yourselves?
line 15558-->  FIRST CITIZEN. We cannot, sir; we are undone already.
line 15559-->  MENENIUS. I tell you, friends, most charitable care  
line 15560-->    Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
line 15561-->    Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
line 15562-->    Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
line 15563-->    Against the Roman state; whose course will on
line 15564-->    The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
line 15565-->    Of more strong link asunder than can ever
line 15566-->    Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
line 15567-->    The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
line 15568-->    Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
line 15569-->    You are transported by calamity
line 15570-->    Thither where more attends you; and you slander
line 15571-->    The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,
line 15572-->    When you curse them as enemies.
line 15573-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us
line 15574-->    yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses cramm'd with
line 15575-->    grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily
line 15576-->    any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more
line 15577-->    piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the
line 15578-->    wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear
line 15579-->    us.  
line 15580-->  MENENIUS. Either you must
line 15581-->    Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
line 15582-->    Or be accus'd of folly. I shall tell you
line 15583-->    A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
line 15584-->    But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
line 15585-->    To stale't a little more.
line 15586-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to
line 15587-->    fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver.
line 15588-->  MENENIUS. There was a time when all the body's members
line 15589-->    Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:
line 15590-->    That only like a gulf it did remain
line 15591-->    I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive,
line 15592-->    Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
line 15593-->    Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments
line 15594-->    Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
line 15595-->    And, mutually participate, did minister
line 15596-->    Unto the appetite and affection common
line 15597-->    Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-
line 15598-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
line 15599-->  MENENIUS. Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,  
line 15600-->    Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-
line 15601-->    For look you, I may make the belly smile
line 15602-->    As well as speak- it tauntingly replied
line 15603-->    To th' discontented members, the mutinous parts
line 15604-->    That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
line 15605-->    As you malign our senators for that
line 15606-->    They are not such as you.
line 15607-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Your belly's answer- What?
line 15608-->    The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,
line 15609-->    The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
line 15610-->    Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,
line 15611-->    With other muniments and petty helps
line 15612-->    Is this our fabric, if that they-
line 15613-->  MENENIUS. What then?
line 15614-->    Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?
line 15615-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
line 15616-->    Who is the sink o' th' body-
line 15617-->  MENENIUS. Well, what then?
line 15618-->  FIRST CITIZEN. The former agents, if they did complain,
line 15619-->    What could the belly answer?  
line 15620-->  MENENIUS. I will tell you;
line 15621-->    If you'll bestow a small- of what you have little-
line 15622-->    Patience awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.
line 15623-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Y'are long about it.
line 15624-->  MENENIUS. Note me this, good friend:
line 15625-->    Your most grave belly was deliberate,
line 15626-->    Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.
line 15627-->    'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
line 15628-->    'That I receive the general food at first
line 15629-->    Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
line 15630-->    Because I am the storehouse and the shop
line 15631-->    Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,
line 15632-->    I send it through the rivers of your blood,
line 15633-->    Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain;
line 15634-->    And, through the cranks and offices of man,
line 15635-->    The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
line 15636-->    From me receive that natural competency
line 15637-->    Whereby they live. And though that all at once
line 15638-->    You, my good friends'- this says the belly; mark me.
line 15639-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, sir; well, well.  
line 15640-->  MENENIUS. 'Though all at once cannot
line 15641-->    See what I do deliver out to each,
line 15642-->    Yet I can make my audit up, that all
line 15643-->    From me do back receive the flour of all,
line 15644-->    And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?
line 15645-->  FIRST CITIZEN. It was an answer. How apply you this?
line 15646-->  MENENIUS. The senators of Rome are this good belly,
line 15647-->    And you the mutinous members; for, examine
line 15648-->    Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
line 15649-->    Touching the weal o' th' common, you shall find
line 15650-->    No public benefit which you receive
line 15651-->    But it proceeds or comes from them to you,
line 15652-->    And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
line 15653-->    You, the great toe of this assembly?
line 15654-->  FIRST CITIZEN. I the great toe? Why the great toe?
line 15655-->  MENENIUS. For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,
line 15656-->    Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.
line 15657-->    Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
line 15658-->    Lead'st first to win some vantage.
line 15659-->    But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.  
line 15660-->    Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
line 15661-->    The one side must have bale.
line 15662-->
line 15663-->                      Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
line 15664-->
line 15665-->    Hail, noble Marcius!
line 15666-->  MARCIUS. Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues
line 15667-->    That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
line 15668-->    Make yourselves scabs?
line 15669-->  FIRST CITIZEN. We have ever your good word.
line 15670-->  MARCIUS. He that will give good words to thee will flatter
line 15671-->    Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
line 15672-->    That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,
line 15673-->    The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
line 15674-->    Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
line 15675-->    Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,
line 15676-->    Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
line 15677-->    Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
line 15678-->    To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,
line 15679-->    And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness  
line 15680-->    Deserves your hate; and your affections are
line 15681-->    A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
line 15682-->    Which would increase his evil. He that depends
line 15683-->    Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,
line 15684-->    And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
line 15685-->    With every minute you do change a mind
line 15686-->    And call him noble that was now your hate,
line 15687-->    Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter
line 15688-->    That in these several places of the city
line 15689-->    You cry against the noble Senate, who,
line 15690-->    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
line 15691-->    Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
line 15692-->  MENENIUS. For corn at their own rates, whereof they say
line 15693-->    The city is well stor'd.
line 15694-->  MARCIUS. Hang 'em! They say!
line 15695-->    They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know
line 15696-->    What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,
line 15697-->    Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out
line 15698-->    Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,
line 15699-->    And feebling such as stand not in their liking  
line 15700-->    Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
line 15701-->    Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
line 15702-->    And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
line 15703-->    With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
line 15704-->    As I could pick my lance.
line 15705-->  MENENIUS. Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
line 15706-->    For though abundantly they lack discretion,
line 15707-->    Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
line 15708-->    What says the other troop?
line 15709-->  MARCIUS. They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!
line 15710-->    They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs-
line 15711-->    That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
line 15712-->    That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
line 15713-->    Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds
line 15714-->    They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
line 15715-->    And a petition granted them- a strange one,
line 15716-->    To break the heart of generosity
line 15717-->    And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps
line 15718-->    As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,
line 15719-->    Shouting their emulation.  
line 15720-->  MENENIUS. What is granted them?
line 15721-->  MARCIUS. Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
line 15722-->    Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-
line 15723-->    Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath!
line 15724-->    The rabble should have first unroof'd the city
line 15725-->    Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time
line 15726-->    Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
line 15727-->    For insurrection's arguing.
line 15728-->  MENENIUS. This is strange.
line 15729-->  MARCIUS. Go get you home, you fragments.
line 15730-->
line 15731-->                     Enter a MESSENGER, hastily
line 15732-->
line 15733-->  MESSENGER. Where's Caius Marcius?
line 15734-->  MARCIUS. Here. What's the matter?
line 15735-->  MESSENGER. The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
line 15736-->  MARCIUS. I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent
line 15737-->    Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
line 15738-->
line 15739-->         Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with other SENATORS;  
line 15740-->                  JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS
line 15741-->
line 15742-->  FIRST SENATOR. Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us:
line 15743-->    The Volsces are in arms.
line 15744-->  MARCIUS. They have a leader,
line 15745-->    Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
line 15746-->    I sin in envying his nobility;
line 15747-->    And were I anything but what I am,
line 15748-->    I would wish me only he.
line 15749-->  COMINIUS. You have fought together?
line 15750-->  MARCIUS. Were half to half the world by th' ears, and he
line 15751-->    Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make
line 15752-->    Only my wars with him. He is a lion
line 15753-->    That I am proud to hunt.
line 15754-->  FIRST SENATOR. Then, worthy Marcius,
line 15755-->    Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
line 15756-->  COMINIUS. It is your former promise.
line 15757-->  MARCIUS. Sir, it is;
line 15758-->    And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
line 15759-->    Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.  
line 15760-->    What, art thou stiff? Stand'st out?
line 15761-->  LARTIUS. No, Caius Marcius;
line 15762-->    I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
line 15763-->    Ere stay behind this business.
line 15764-->  MENENIUS. O, true bred!
line 15765-->  FIRST SENATOR. Your company to th' Capitol; where, I know,
line 15766-->    Our greatest friends attend us.
line 15767-->  LARTIUS.  [To COMINIUS]  Lead you on.
line 15768-->    [To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;
line 15769-->    Right worthy you priority.
line 15770-->  COMINIUS. Noble Marcius!
line 15771-->  FIRST SENATOR.  [To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone.
line 15772-->  MARCIUS. Nay, let them follow.
line 15773-->    The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither
line 15774-->    To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,
line 15775-->    Your valour puts well forth; pray follow.
line 15776-->         Ciitzens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
line 15777-->  SICINIUS. Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
line 15778-->  BRUTUS. He has no equal.
line 15779-->  SICINIUS. When we were chosen tribunes for the people-  
line 15780-->  BRUTUS. Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
line 15781-->  SICINIUS. Nay, but his taunts!
line 15782-->  BRUTUS. Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.
line 15783-->  SICINIUS. Bemock the modest moon.
line 15784-->  BRUTUS. The present wars devour him! He is grown
line 15785-->    Too proud to be so valiant.
line 15786-->  SICINIUS. Such a nature,
line 15787-->    Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
line 15788-->    Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
line 15789-->    His insolence can brook to be commanded
line 15790-->    Under Cominius.
line 15791-->  BRUTUS. Fame, at the which he aims-
line 15792-->    In whom already he is well grac'd- cannot
line 15793-->    Better be held nor more attain'd than by
line 15794-->    A place below the first; for what miscarries
line 15795-->    Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
line 15796-->    To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure
line 15797-->    Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
line 15798-->    Had borne the business!'
line 15799-->  SICINIUS. Besides, if things go well,  
line 15800-->    Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
line 15801-->    Of his demerits rob Cominius.
line 15802-->  BRUTUS. Come.
line 15803-->    Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
line 15804-->    Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
line 15805-->    To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
line 15806-->    In aught he merit not.
line 15807-->  SICINIUS. Let's hence and hear
line 15808-->    How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
line 15809-->    More than his singularity, he goes
line 15810-->    Upon this present action.
line 15811-->  BRUTUS. Let's along.                                    Exeunt
line 15812-->
line 15813-->
line 15814-->
line 15815-->
line 15816-->SCENE II.
line 15817-->Corioli. The Senate House.
line 15818-->
line 15819-->Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with SENATORS of Corioli
line 15820-->
line 15821-->  FIRST SENATOR. So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
line 15822-->    That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels
line 15823-->    And know how we proceed.
line 15824-->  AUFIDIUS. Is it not yours?
line 15825-->    What ever have been thought on in this state
line 15826-->    That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
line 15827-->    Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
line 15828-->    Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think
line 15829-->    I have the letter here;.yes, here it is:
line 15830-->    [Reads]  'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
line 15831-->    Whether for east or west. The dearth is great;
line 15832-->    The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
line 15833-->    Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
line 15834-->    Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
line 15835-->    And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
line 15836-->    These three lead on this preparation
line 15837-->    Whither 'tis bent. Most likely 'tis for you;  
line 15838-->    Consider of it.'
line 15839-->  FIRST SENATOR. Our army's in the field;
line 15840-->    We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
line 15841-->    To answer us.
line 15842-->  AUFIDIUS. Nor did you think it folly
line 15843-->    To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
line 15844-->    They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
line 15845-->    It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery
line 15846-->    We shall be short'ned in our aim, which was
line 15847-->    To take in many towns ere almost Rome
line 15848-->    Should know we were afoot.
line 15849-->  SECOND SENATOR. Noble Aufidius,
line 15850-->    Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
line 15851-->    Let us alone to guard Corioli.
line 15852-->    If they set down before's, for the remove
line 15853-->    Bring up your army; but I think you'll find
line 15854-->    Th' have not prepar'd for us.
line 15855-->  AUFIDIUS. O, doubt not that!
line 15856-->    I speak from certainties. Nay more,
line 15857-->    Some parcels of their power are forth already,  
line 15858-->    And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
line 15859-->    If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
line 15860-->    'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
line 15861-->    Till one can do no more.
line 15862-->  ALL. The gods assist you!
line 15863-->  AUFIDIUS. And keep your honours safe!
line 15864-->  FIRST SENATOR. Farewell.
line 15865-->  SECOND SENATOR. Farewell.
line 15866-->  ALL. Farewell.                                           Exeunt

line 15870-->
line 15871-->SCENE III.
line 15872-->Rome. MARCIUS' house
line 15873-->
line 15874-->Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA, mother and wife to MARCIUS;
line 15875-->they set them down on two low stools and sew
line 15876-->
line 15877-->  VOLUMNIA. I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more
line 15878-->    comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier
line 15879-->    rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
line 15880-->    embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet
line 15881-->    he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth
line 15882-->    with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of
line 15883-->    kings' entreaties, a mother should not sell him an hour from her
line 15884-->    beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a person-
line 15885-->    that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall, if
line 15886-->    renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where
line 15887-->    he was to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
line 15888-->    return'd his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I
line 15889-->    sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than
line 15890-->    now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.
line 15891-->  VIRGILIA. But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
line 15892-->  VOLUMNIA. Then his good report should have been my son; I therein  
line 15893-->    would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen
line 15894-->    sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my
line 15895-->    good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
line 15896-->    than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
line 15897-->
line 15898-->                        Enter a GENTLEWOMAN
line 15899-->
line 15900-->  GENTLEWOMAN. Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
line 15901-->  VIRGILIA. Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.
line 15902-->  VOLUMNIA. Indeed you shall not.
line 15903-->    Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum;
line 15904-->    See him pluck Aufidius down by th' hair;
line 15905-->    As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.
line 15906-->    Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
line 15907-->    'Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,
line 15908-->    Though you were born in Rome.' His bloody brow
line 15909-->    With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
line 15910-->    Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
line 15911-->    Or all or lose his hire.
line 15912-->  VIRGILIA. His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!  
line 15913-->  VOLUMNIA. Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
line 15914-->    Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,
line 15915-->    When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
line 15916-->    Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
line 15917-->    At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria
line 15918-->    We are fit to bid her welcome.              Exit GENTLEWOMAN
line 15919-->  VIRGILIA. Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
line 15920-->  VOLUMNIA. He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
line 15921-->    And tread upon his neck.
line 15922-->
line 15923-->         Re-enter GENTLEWOMAN, With VALERIA and an usher
line 15924-->
line 15925-->  VALERIA. My ladies both, good day to you.
line 15926-->  VOLUMNIA. Sweet madam!
line 15927-->  VIRGILIA. I am glad to see your ladyship.
line 15928-->  VALERIA. How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are
line 15929-->    you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little
line 15930-->    son?
line 15931-->  VIRGILIA. I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
line 15932-->  VOLUMNIA. He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look  
line 15933-->    upon his schoolmaster.
line 15934-->  VALERIA. O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very
line 15935-->    pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an
line 15936-->    hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run
line 15937-->    after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go
line 15938-->    again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up
line 15939-->    again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how
line 15940-->    'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he
line 15941-->    mammock'd it!
line 15942-->  VOLUMNIA. One on's father's moods.
line 15943-->  VALERIA. Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
line 15944-->  VIRGILIA. A crack, madam.
line 15945-->  VALERIA. Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the
line 15946-->    idle huswife with me this afternoon.
line 15947-->  VIRGILIA. No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
line 15948-->  VALERIA. Not out of doors!
line 15949-->  VOLUMNIA. She shall, she shall.
line 15950-->  VIRGILIA. Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold
line 15951-->    till my lord return from the wars.
line 15952-->  VALERIA. Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you  
line 15953-->    must go visit the good lady that lies in.
line 15954-->  VIRGILIA. I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my
line 15955-->    prayers; but I cannot go thither.
line 15956-->  VOLUMNIA. Why, I pray you?
line 15957-->  VIRGILIA. 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
line 15958-->  VALERIA. You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn
line 15959-->    she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
line 15960-->    Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you
line 15961-->    might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
line 15962-->  VIRGILIA. No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.
line 15963-->  VALERIA. In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news
line 15964-->    of your husband.
line 15965-->  VIRGILIA. O, good madam, there can be none yet.
line 15966-->  VALERIA. Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him
line 15967-->    last night.
line 15968-->  VIRGILIA. Indeed, madam?
line 15969-->  VALERIA. In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it
line 15970-->    is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the
line 15971-->    general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and
line 15972-->    Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they  
line 15973-->    nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
line 15974-->    on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
line 15975-->  VIRGILIA. Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything
line 15976-->    hereafter.
line 15977-->  VOLUMNIA. Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease
line 15978-->    our better mirth.
line 15979-->  VALERIA. In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come,
line 15980-->    good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o'
line 15981-->    door and go along with us.
line 15982-->  VIRGILIA. No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much
line 15983-->    mirth.
line 15984-->  VALERIA. Well then, farewell.                           Exeunt
line 15985-->
line 15986-->

line 15988-->
line 15989-->SCENE IV.
line 15990-->Before Corioli
line 15991-->
line 15992-->Enter MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with drum and colours,
line 15993-->with CAPTAINS and soldiers. To them a MESSENGER
line 15994-->
line 15995-->  MARCIUS. Yonder comes news; a wager- they have met.
line 15996-->  LARTIUS. My horse to yours- no.
line 15997-->  MARCIUS. 'Tis done.
line 15998-->  LARTIUS. Agreed.
line 15999-->  MARCIUS. Say, has our general met the enemy?
line 16000-->  MESSENGER. They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.
line 16001-->  LARTIUS. So, the good horse is mine.
line 16002-->  MARCIUS. I'll buy him of you.
line 16003-->  LARTIUS. No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
line 16004-->    For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
line 16005-->  MARCIUS. How far off lie these armies?
line 16006-->  MESSENGER. Within this mile and half.
line 16007-->  MARCIUS. Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
line 16008-->    Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
line 16009-->    That we with smoking swords may march from hence
line 16010-->    To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.  
line 16011-->
line 16012-->          They sound a parley. Enter two SENATORS with others,
line 16013-->                      on the walls of Corioli
line 16014-->
line 16015-->    Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
line 16016-->  FIRST SENATOR. No, nor a man that fears you less than he:
line 16017-->    That's lesser than a little.  [Drum afar off]  Hark, our drums
line 16018-->    Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls
line 16019-->    Rather than they shall pound us up; our gates,
line 16020-->    Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
line 16021-->    They'll open of themselves.  [Alarum far off]  Hark you far off!
line 16022-->    There is Aufidius. List what work he makes
line 16023-->    Amongst your cloven army.
line 16024-->  MARCIUS. O, they are at it!
line 16025-->  LARTIUS. Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
line 16026-->
line 16027-->                   Enter the army of the Volsces
line 16028-->
line 16029-->  MARCIUS. They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
line 16030-->    Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight  
line 16031-->    With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus.
line 16032-->    They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
line 16033-->    Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows.
line 16034-->    He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
line 16035-->    And he shall feel mine edge.
line 16036-->
line 16037-->          Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches.
line 16038-->                      Re-enter MARCIUS, cursing
line 16039-->
line 16040-->  MARCIUS. All the contagion of the south light on you,
line 16041-->    You shames of Rome! you herd of- Boils and plagues
line 16042-->    Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
line 16043-->    Farther than seen, and one infect another
line 16044-->    Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
line 16045-->    That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
line 16046-->    From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
line 16047-->    All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale
line 16048-->    With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
line 16049-->    Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
line 16050-->    And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;  
line 16051-->    If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives,
line 16052-->    As they us to our trenches. Follow me.
line 16053-->
line 16054-->         Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows
line 16055-->                          them to the gates
line 16056-->
line 16057-->    So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds;
line 16058-->    'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
line 16059-->    Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.
line 16060-->
line 16061-->                    [MARCIUS enters the gates]
line 16062-->
line 16063-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Fool-hardiness; not I.
line 16064-->  SECOND SOLDIER. Not I.                    [MARCIUS is shut in]
line 16065-->  FIRST SOLDIER. See, they have shut him in.
line 16066-->  ALL. To th' pot, I warrant him.             [Alarum continues]
line 16067-->
line 16068-->                      Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS
line 16069-->
line 16070-->  LARTIUS. What is become of Marcius?  
line 16071-->  ALL. Slain, sir, doubtless.
line 16072-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Following the fliers at the very heels,
line 16073-->    With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
line 16074-->    Clapp'd to their gates. He is himself alone,
line 16075-->    To answer all the city.
line 16076-->  LARTIUS. O noble fellow!
line 16077-->    Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
line 16078-->    And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
line 16079-->    A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
line 16080-->    Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
line 16081-->    Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
line 16082-->    Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and
line 16083-->    The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
line 16084-->    Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
line 16085-->    Were feverous and did tremble.
line 16086-->
line 16087-->          Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy
line 16088-->
line 16089-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Look, sir.
line 16090-->  LARTIUS. O, 'tis Marcius!  
line 16091-->    Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
line 16092-->                            [They fight, and all enter the city]

line 16096-->
line 16097-->SCENE V.
line 16098-->Within Corioli. A street
line 16099-->
line 16100-->Enter certain Romans, with spoils
line 16101-->
line 16102-->  FIRST ROMAN. This will I carry to Rome.
line 16103-->  SECOND ROMAN. And I this.
line 16104-->  THIRD ROMAN. A murrain on 't! I took this for silver.
line 16105-->                               [Alarum continues still afar off]
line 16106-->
line 16107-->          Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS With a trumpeter
line 16108-->
line 16109-->  MARCIUS. See here these movers that do prize their hours
line 16110-->    At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
line 16111-->    Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
line 16112-->    Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
line 16113-->    Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!
line 16114-->                                                Exeunt pillagers
line 16115-->    And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
line 16116-->    There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
line 16117-->    Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take
line 16118-->    Convenient numbers to make good the city;  
line 16119-->    Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
line 16120-->    To help Cominius.
line 16121-->  LARTIUS. Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
line 16122-->    Thy exercise hath been too violent
line 16123-->    For a second course of fight.
line 16124-->  MARCIUS. Sir, praise me not;
line 16125-->    My work hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you well;
line 16126-->    The blood I drop is rather physical
line 16127-->    Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
line 16128-->    I will appear, and fight.
line 16129-->  LARTIUS. Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
line 16130-->    Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms
line 16131-->    Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
line 16132-->    Prosperity be thy page!
line 16133-->  MARCIUS. Thy friend no less
line 16134-->    Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.
line 16135-->  LARTIUS. Thou worthiest Marcius!                  Exit MARCIUS
line 16136-->    Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
line 16137-->    Call thither all the officers o' th' town,
line 16138-->    Where they shall know our mind. Away!                 Exeunt

line 16142-->
line 16143-->SCENE VI.
line 16144-->Near the camp of COMINIUS
line 16145-->
line 16146-->Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers
line 16147-->
line 16148-->  COMINIUS. Breathe you, my friends. Well fought; we are come off
line 16149-->    Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
line 16150-->    Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,
line 16151-->    We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,
line 16152-->    By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
line 16153-->    The charges of our friends. The Roman gods,
line 16154-->    Lead their successes as we wish our own,
line 16155-->    That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount'ring,
line 16156-->    May give you thankful sacrifice!
line 16157-->
line 16158-->                         Enter A MESSENGER
line 16159-->
line 16160-->    Thy news?
line 16161-->  MESSENGER. The citizens of Corioli have issued
line 16162-->    And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;
line 16163-->    I saw our party to their trenches driven,
line 16164-->    And then I came away.  
line 16165-->  COMINIUS. Though thou speak'st truth,
line 16166-->    Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?
line 16167-->  MESSENGER. Above an hour, my lord.
line 16168-->  COMINIUS. 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
line 16169-->    How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
line 16170-->    And bring thy news so late?
line 16171-->  MESSENGER. Spies of the Volsces
line 16172-->    Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to wheel
line 16173-->    Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,
line 16174-->    Half an hour since brought my report.
line 16175-->
line 16176-->                           Enter MARCIUS
line 16177-->
line 16178-->  COMINIUS. Who's yonder
line 16179-->    That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!
line 16180-->    He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have
line 16181-->    Before-time seen him thus.
line 16182-->  MARCIUS. Come I too late?
line 16183-->  COMINIUS. The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
line 16184-->    More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue  
line 16185-->    From every meaner man.
line 16186-->  MARCIUS. Come I too late?
line 16187-->  COMINIUS. Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
line 16188-->    But mantled in your own.
line 16189-->  MARCIUS. O! let me clip ye
line 16190-->    In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
line 16191-->    As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
line 16192-->    And tapers burn'd to bedward.
line 16193-->  COMINIUS. Flower of warriors,
line 16194-->    How is't with Titus Lartius?
line 16195-->  MARCIUS. As with a man busied about decrees:
line 16196-->    Condemning some to death and some to exile;
line 16197-->    Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;
line 16198-->    Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
line 16199-->    Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
line 16200-->    To let him slip at will.
line 16201-->  COMINIUS. Where is that slave
line 16202-->    Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
line 16203-->    Where is he? Call him hither.
line 16204-->  MARCIUS. Let him alone;  
line 16205-->    He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,
line 16206-->    The common file- a plague! tribunes for them!
line 16207-->    The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
line 16208-->    From rascals worse than they.
line 16209-->  COMINIUS. But how prevail'd you?
line 16210-->  MARCIUS. Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
line 16211-->    Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field?
line 16212-->    If not, why cease you till you are so?
line 16213-->  COMINIUS. Marcius,
line 16214-->    We have at disadvantage fought, and did
line 16215-->    Retire to win our purpose.
line 16216-->  MARCIUS. How lies their battle? Know you on which side
line 16217-->    They have plac'd their men of trust?
line 16218-->  COMINIUS. As I guess, Marcius,
line 16219-->    Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,
line 16220-->    Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
line 16221-->    Their very heart of hope.
line 16222-->  MARCIUS. I do beseech you,
line 16223-->    By all the battles wherein we have fought,
line 16224-->    By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows  
line 16225-->    We have made to endure friends, that you directly
line 16226-->    Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
line 16227-->    And that you not delay the present, but,
line 16228-->    Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts,
line 16229-->    We prove this very hour.
line 16230-->  COMINIUS. Though I could wish
line 16231-->    You were conducted to a gentle bath
line 16232-->    And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
line 16233-->    Deny your asking: take your choice of those
line 16234-->    That best can aid your action.
line 16235-->  MARCIUS. Those are they
line 16236-->    That most are willing. If any such be here-
line 16237-->    As it were sin to doubt- that love this painting
line 16238-->    Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
line 16239-->    Lesser his person than an ill report;
line 16240-->    If any think brave death outweighs bad life
line 16241-->    And that his country's dearer than himself;
line 16242-->    Let him alone, or so many so minded,
line 16243-->    Wave thus to express his disposition,
line 16244-->    And follow Marcius.           [They all shout and wave their  
line 16245-->       swords, take him up in their arms and cast up their caps]
line 16246-->    O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?
line 16247-->    If these shows be not outward, which of you
line 16248-->    But is four Volsces? None of you but is
line 16249-->    Able to bear against the great Aufidius
line 16250-->    A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
line 16251-->    Though thanks to all, must I select from all; the rest
line 16252-->    Shall bear the business in some other fight,
line 16253-->    As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
line 16254-->    And four shall quickly draw out my command,
line 16255-->    Which men are best inclin'd.
line 16256-->  COMINIUS. March on, my fellows;
line 16257-->    Make good this ostentation, and you shall
line 16258-->    Divide in all with us.                                Exeunt

line 16264-->The gates of Corioli
line 16265-->
line 16266-->TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with drum and trumpet
line 16267-->toward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with a LIEUTENANT, other soldiers,
line 16268-->and a scout
line 16269-->
line 16270-->  LARTIUS. So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties
line 16271-->    As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
line 16272-->    Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
line 16273-->    For a short holding. If we lose the field
line 16274-->    We cannot keep the town.
line 16275-->  LIEUTENANT. Fear not our care, sir.
line 16276-->  LARTIUS. Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
line 16277-->    Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us.       Exeunt

line 16282-->SCENE VIII.
line 16283-->A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
line 16284-->
line 16285-->Alarum, as in battle. Enter MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS at several doors
line 16286-->
line 16287-->  MARCIUS. I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
line 16288-->    Worse than a promise-breaker.
line 16289-->  AUFIDIUS. We hate alike:
line 16290-->    Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
line 16291-->    More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
line 16292-->  MARCIUS. Let the first budger die the other's slave,
line 16293-->    And the gods doom him after!
line 16294-->  AUFIDIUS. If I fly, Marcius,
line 16295-->    Halloa me like a hare.
line 16296-->  MARCIUS. Within these three hours, Tullus,
line 16297-->    Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
line 16298-->    And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blood
line 16299-->    Wherein thou seest me mask'd. For thy revenge
line 16300-->    Wrench up thy power to th' highest.
line 16301-->  AUFIDIUS. Wert thou the Hector
line 16302-->    That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,  
line 16303-->    Thou shouldst not scape me here.
line 16304-->
line 16305-->       Here they fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid
line 16306-->        of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in
line 16307-->                             breathless
line 16308-->
line 16309-->    Officious, and not valiant, you have sham'd me
line 16310-->    In your condemned seconds.                            Exeunt
line 16311-->

line 16314-->
line 16315-->SCENE IX.
line 16316-->The Roman camp
line 16317-->
line 16318-->Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Enter, at one door,
line 16319-->COMINIUS with the Romans; at another door, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf
line 16320-->
line 16321-->  COMINIUS. If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
line 16322-->    Thou't not believe thy deeds; but I'll report it
line 16323-->    Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;
line 16324-->    Where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,
line 16325-->    I' th' end admire; where ladies shall be frighted
line 16326-->    And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
line 16327-->    That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
line 16328-->    Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
line 16329-->    Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
line 16330-->    Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast,
line 16331-->    Having fully din'd before.
line 16332-->
line 16333-->         Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit
line 16334-->
line 16335-->  LARTIUS. O General,  
line 16336-->    Here is the steed, we the caparison.
line 16337-->    Hadst thou beheld-
line 16338-->  MARCIUS. Pray now, no more; my mother,
line 16339-->    Who has a charter to extol her blood,
line 16340-->    When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
line 16341-->    As you have done- that's what I can; induc'd
line 16342-->    As you have been- that's for my country.
line 16343-->    He that has but effected his good will
line 16344-->    Hath overta'en mine act.
line 16345-->  COMINIUS. You shall not be
line 16346-->    The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
line 16347-->    The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment
line 16348-->    Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
line 16349-->    To hide your doings and to silence that
line 16350-->    Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
line 16351-->    Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you,
line 16352-->    In sign of what you are, not to reward
line 16353-->    What you have done, before our army hear me.
line 16354-->  MARCIUS. I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
line 16355-->    To hear themselves rememb'red.  
line 16356-->  COMINIUS. Should they not,
line 16357-->    Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude
line 16358-->    And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses-
line 16359-->    Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store- of all
line 16360-->    The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,
line 16361-->    We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth
line 16362-->    Before the common distribution at
line 16363-->    Your only choice.
line 16364-->  MARCIUS. I thank you, General,
line 16365-->    But cannot make my heart consent to take
line 16366-->    A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
line 16367-->    And stand upon my common part with those
line 16368-->    That have beheld the doing.
line 16369-->
line 16370-->           A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
line 16371-->   cast up their caps and lances. COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare
line 16372-->
line 16373-->    May these same instruments which you profane
line 16374-->    Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall
line 16375-->    I' th' field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be  
line 16376-->    Made all of false-fac'd soothing. When steel grows
line 16377-->    Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made
line 16378-->    An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.
line 16379-->    For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled,
line 16380-->    Or foil'd some debile wretch, which without note
line 16381-->    Here's many else have done, you shout me forth
line 16382-->    In acclamations hyperbolical,
line 16383-->    As if I lov'd my little should be dieted
line 16384-->    In praises sauc'd with lies.
line 16385-->  COMINIUS. Too modest are you;
line 16386-->    More cruel to your good report than grateful
line 16387-->    To us that give you truly. By your patience,
line 16388-->    If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'll put you-
line 16389-->    Like one that means his proper harm- in manacles,
line 16390-->    Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,
line 16391-->    As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
line 16392-->    Wears this war's garland; in token of the which,
line 16393-->    My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
line 16394-->    With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
line 16395-->    For what he did before Corioli, can him  
line 16396-->    With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,
line 16397-->    Caius Marcius Coriolanus.
line 16398-->    Bear th' addition nobly ever!
line 16399-->                           [Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums]
line 16400-->  ALL. Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
line 16401-->  CORIOLANUS. I will go wash;
line 16402-->    And when my face is fair you shall perceive
line 16403-->    Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you;
line 16404-->    I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
line 16405-->    To undercrest your good addition
line 16406-->    To th' fairness of my power.
line 16407-->  COMINIUS. So, to our tent;
line 16408-->    Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
line 16409-->    To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
line 16410-->    Must to Corioli back. Send us to Rome
line 16411-->    The best, with whom we may articulate
line 16412-->    For their own good and ours.
line 16413-->  LARTIUS. I shall, my lord.
line 16414-->  CORIOLANUS. The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
line 16415-->    Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg  
line 16416-->    Of my Lord General.
line 16417-->  COMINIUS. Take't- 'tis yours; what is't?
line 16418-->  CORIOLANUS. I sometime lay here in Corioli
line 16419-->    At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly.
line 16420-->    He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
line 16421-->    But then Aufidius was within my view,
line 16422-->    And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you
line 16423-->    To give my poor host freedom.
line 16424-->  COMINIUS. O, well begg'd!
line 16425-->    Were he the butcher of my son, he should
line 16426-->    Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
line 16427-->  LARTIUS. Marcius, his name?
line 16428-->  CORIOLANUS. By Jupiter, forgot!
line 16429-->    I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.
line 16430-->    Have we no wine here?
line 16431-->  COMINIUS. Go we to our tent.
line 16432-->    The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
line 16433-->    It should be look'd to. Come.                         Exeunt
line 16434-->
line 16435-->
line 16436-->
line 16437-->
line 16438-->SCENE X.
line 16439-->The camp of the Volsces
line 16440-->
line 16441-->A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
line 16442-->
line 16443-->  AUFIDIUS. The town is ta'en.
line 16444-->  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
line 16445-->  AUFIDIUS. Condition!
line 16446-->    I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
line 16447-->    Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?
line 16448-->    What good condition can a treaty find
line 16449-->    I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
line 16450-->    I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
line 16451-->    And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
line 16452-->    As often as we eat. By th' elements,
line 16453-->    If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
line 16454-->    He's mine or I am his. Mine emulation
line 16455-->    Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
line 16456-->    I thought to crush him in an equal force,
line 16457-->    True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,
line 16458-->    Or wrath or craft may get him.  
line 16459-->  FIRST SOLDIER. He's the devil.
line 16460-->  AUFIDIUS. Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
line 16461-->    With only suff'ring stain by him; for him
line 16462-->    Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,
line 16463-->    Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
line 16464-->    The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
line 16465-->    Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
line 16466-->    Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
line 16467-->    My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it
line 16468-->    At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
line 16469-->    Against the hospitable canon, would I
line 16470-->    Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' city;
line 16471-->    Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must
line 16472-->    Be hostages for Rome.
line 16473-->  FIRST SOLDIER. Will not you go?
line 16474-->  AUFIDIUS. I am attended at the cypress grove; I pray you-
line 16475-->    'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
line 16476-->    How the world goes, that to the pace of it
line 16477-->    I may spur on my journey.
line 16478-->  FIRST SOLDIER. I shall, sir.                            Exeunt

line 16493-->
line 16494-->ACT II. SCENE I.
line 16495-->Rome. A public place
line 16496-->
line 16497-->Enter MENENIUS, with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS
line 16498-->
line 16499-->  MENENIUS. The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
line 16500-->  BRUTUS. Good or bad?
line 16501-->  MENENIUS. Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love
line 16502-->    not Marcius.
line 16503-->  SICINIUS. Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
line 16504-->  MENENIUS. Pray you, who does the wolf love?
line 16505-->  SICINIUS. The lamb.
line 16506-->  MENENIUS. Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the
line 16507-->    noble Marcius.
line 16508-->  BRUTUS. He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
line 16509-->  MENENIUS. He's a bear indeed, that lives fike a lamb. You two are
line 16510-->    old men; tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
line 16511-->  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, sir.
line 16512-->  MENENIUS. In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not
line 16513-->    in abundance?
line 16514-->  BRUTUS. He's poor in no one fault, but stor'd with all.  
line 16515-->  SICINIUS. Especially in pride.
line 16516-->  BRUTUS. And topping all others in boasting.
line 16517-->  MENENIUS. This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured
line 16518-->    here in the city- I mean of us o' th' right-hand file? Do you?
line 16519-->  BOTH TRIBUNES. Why, how are we censur'd?
line 16520-->  MENENIUS. Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry?
line 16521-->  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, well, sir, well.
line 16522-->  MENENIUS. Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
line 16523-->    occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your
line 16524-->    dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures- at the
line 16525-->    least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame
line 16526-->    Marcius for being proud?
line 16527-->  BRUTUS. We do it not alone, sir.
line 16528-->  MENENIUS. I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are
line 16529-->    many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your
line 16530-->    abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of
line 16531-->    pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
line 16532-->    necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O
line 16533-->    that you could!
line 16534-->  BOTH TRIBUNES. What then, sir?  
line 16535-->  MENENIUS. Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
line 16536-->    proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in Rome.
line 16537-->  SICINIUS. Menenius, you are known well enough too.
line 16538-->  MENENIUS. I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves
line 16539-->    a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to
line 16540-->    be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty
line 16541-->    and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
line 16542-->    with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
line 16543-->    morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
line 16544-->    Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I cannot call you
line 16545-->    Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I
line 16546-->    make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have
line 16547-->    deliver'd the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with
line 16548-->    the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to
line 16549-->    bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie
line 16550-->    deadly that tell you you have good faces. If you see this in the
line 16551-->    map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too?
line 16552-->    What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
line 16553-->    character, if I be known well enough too?
line 16554-->  BRUTUS. Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.  
line 16555-->  MENENIUS. You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are
line 16556-->    ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good
line 16557-->    wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and
line 16558-->    a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
line 16559-->    to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter
line 16560-->    between party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the
line 16561-->    colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag
line 16562-->    against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss
line 16563-->    the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All
line 16564-->    the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
line 16565-->    knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.
line 16566-->  BRUTUS. Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
line 16567-->    for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
line 16568-->  MENENIUS. Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
line 16569-->    encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak
line 16570-->    best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your
line 16571-->    beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to
line 16572-->    stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's
line 16573-->    pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a
line 16574-->    cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion;  
line 16575-->    though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
line 16576-->    hangmen. God-den to your worships. More of your conversation
line 16577-->    would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
line 16578-->    plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.
line 16579-->                                  [BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside]
line 16580-->
line 16581-->               Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA
line 16582-->
line 16583-->    How now, my as fair as noble ladies- and the moon, were she
line 16584-->    earthly, no nobler- whither do you follow your eyes so fast?
line 16585-->  VOLUMNIA. Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for the
line 16586-->    love of Juno, let's go.
line 16587-->  MENENIUS. Ha! Marcius coming home?
line 16588-->  VOLUMNIA. Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous
line 16589-->    approbation.
line 16590-->  MENENIUS. Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
line 16591-->    Marcius coming home!
line 16592-->  VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA. Nay, 'tis true.
line 16593-->  VOLUMNIA. Look, here's a letter from him; the state hath another,
line 16594-->    his wife another; and I think there's one at home for you.  
line 16595-->  MENENIUS. I will make my very house reel to-night. A letter for me?
line 16596-->  VIRGILIA. Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
line 16597-->  MENENIUS. A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years'
line 16598-->    health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The
line 16599-->    most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to
line 16600-->    this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
line 16601-->    not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.
line 16602-->  VIRGILIA. O, no, no, no.
line 16603-->  VOLUMNIA. O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.
line 16604-->  MENENIUS. So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings a victory in
line 16605-->    his pocket? The wounds become him.
line 16606-->  VOLUMNIA. On's brows, Menenius, he comes the third time home with
line 16607-->    the oaken garland.
line 16608-->  MENENIUS. Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?
line 16609-->  VOLUMNIA. Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius
line 16610-->    got off.
line 16611-->  MENENIUS. And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that; an he
line 16612-->    had stay'd by him, I would not have been so fidius'd for all the
line 16613-->    chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them. Is the Senate
line 16614-->    possess'd of this?  
line 16615-->  VOLUMNIA. Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has
line 16616-->    letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name
line 16617-->    of the war; he hath in this action outdone his former deeds
line 16618-->    doubly.
line 16619-->  VALERIA. In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
line 16620-->  MENENIUS. Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true
line 16621-->    purchasing.
line 16622-->  VIRGILIA. The gods grant them true!
line 16623-->  VOLUMNIA. True! pow, waw.
line 16624-->  MENENIUS. True! I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded?
line 16625-->    [To the TRIBUNES]  God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
line 16626-->    home; he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
line 16627-->  VOLUMNIA. I' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm; there will be large
line 16628-->    cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
line 16629-->    He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' th' body.
line 16630-->  MENENIUS. One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that I
line 16631-->    know.
line 16632-->  VOLUMNIA. He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds
line 16633-->    upon him.
line 16634-->  MENENIUS. Now it's twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy's grave.  
line 16635-->    [A shout and flourish]  Hark! the trumpets.
line 16636-->  VOLUMNIA. These are the ushers of Marcius. Before him he carries
line 16637-->      noise, and behind him he leaves tears;
line 16638-->    Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie,
line 16639-->    Which, being advanc'd, declines, and then men die.
line 16640-->
line 16641-->            A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
line 16642-->              GENERAL, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them,
line 16643-->           CORIOLANUS, crown'd with an oaken garland; with
line 16644-->                   CAPTAINS and soldiers and a HERALD
line 16645-->
line 16646-->  HERALD. Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
line 16647-->    Within Corioli gates, where he hath won,
line 16648-->    With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
line 16649-->    In honour follows Coriolanus.
line 16650-->    Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!             [Flourish]
line 16651-->  ALL. Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
line 16652-->  CORIOLANUS. No more of this, it does offend my heart.
line 16653-->    Pray now, no more.
line 16654-->  COMINIUS. Look, sir, your mother!  
line 16655-->  CORIOLANUS. O,
line 16656-->    You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
line 16657-->    For my prosperity!                                  [Kneels]
line 16658-->  VOLUMNIA. Nay, my good soldier, up;
line 16659-->    My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
line 16660-->    By deed-achieving honour newly nam'd-
line 16661-->    What is it? Coriolanus must I can thee?
line 16662-->    But, O, thy wife!
line 16663-->  CORIOLANUS. My gracious silence, hail!
line 16664-->    Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
line 16665-->    That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
line 16666-->    Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
line 16667-->    And mothers that lack sons.
line 16668-->  MENENIUS. Now the gods crown thee!
line 16669-->  CORIOLANUS. And live you yet?  [To VALERIA]  O my sweet lady,
line 16670-->    pardon.
line 16671-->  VOLUMNIA. I know not where to turn.
line 16672-->    O, welcome home! And welcome, General.
line 16673-->    And y'are welcome all.
line 16674-->  MENENIUS. A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep  
line 16675-->    And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome!
line 16676-->    A curse begin at very root on's heart
line 16677-->    That is not glad to see thee! You are three
line 16678-->    That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,
line 16679-->    We have some old crab trees here at home that will not
line 16680-->    Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors.
line 16681-->    We call a nettle but a nettle, and
line 16682-->    The faults of fools but folly.
line 16683-->  COMINIUS. Ever right.
line 16684-->  CORIOLANUS. Menenius ever, ever.
line 16685-->  HERALD. Give way there, and go on.
line 16686-->  CORIOLANUS.  [To his wife and mother]  Your hand, and yours.
line 16687-->    Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
line 16688-->    The good patricians must be visited;
line 16689-->    From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings,
line 16690-->    But with them change of honours.
line 16691-->  VOLUMNIA. I have lived
line 16692-->    To see inherited my very wishes,
line 16693-->    And the buildings of my fancy; only
line 16694-->    There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but  
line 16695-->    Our Rome will cast upon thee.
line 16696-->  CORIOLANUS. Know, good mother,
line 16697-->    I had rather be their servant in my way
line 16698-->    Than sway with them in theirs.
line 16699-->  COMINIUS. On, to the Capitol.
line 16700-->                 [Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before]
line 16701-->
line 16702-->                BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward
line 16703-->
line 16704-->  BRUTUS. All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
line 16705-->    Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse
line 16706-->    Into a rapture lets her baby cry
line 16707-->    While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins
line 16708-->    Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
line 16709-->    Clamb'ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows,
line 16710-->    Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
line 16711-->    With variable complexions, all agreeing
line 16712-->    In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
line 16713-->    Do press among the popular throngs and puff
line 16714-->    To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames  
line 16715-->    Commit the war of white and damask in
line 16716-->    Their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil
line 16717-->    Of Phoebus' burning kisses. Such a pother,
line 16718-->    As if that whatsoever god who leads him
line 16719-->    Were slily crept into his human powers,
line 16720-->    And gave him graceful posture.
line 16721-->  SICINIUS. On the sudden
line 16722-->    I warrant him consul.
line 16723-->  BRUTUS. Then our office may
line 16724-->    During his power go sleep.
line 16725-->  SICINIUS. He cannot temp'rately transport his honours
line 16726-->    From where he should begin and end, but will
line 16727-->    Lose those he hath won.
line 16728-->  BRUTUS. In that there's comfort.
line 16729-->  SICINIUS. Doubt not
line 16730-->    The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
line 16731-->    Upon their ancient malice will forget
line 16732-->    With the least cause these his new honours; which
line 16733-->    That he will give them make I as little question
line 16734-->    As he is proud to do't.  
line 16735-->  BRUTUS. I heard him swear,
line 16736-->    Were he to stand for consul, never would he
line 16737-->    Appear i' th' market-place, nor on him put
line 16738-->    The napless vesture of humility;
line 16739-->    Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds
line 16740-->    To th' people, beg their stinking breaths.
line 16741-->  SICINIUS. 'Tis right.
line 16742-->  BRUTUS. It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
line 16743-->    Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
line 16744-->    And the desire of the nobles.
line 16745-->  SICINIUS. I wish no better
line 16746-->    Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it
line 16747-->    In execution.
line 16748-->  BRUTUS. 'Tis most like he will.
line 16749-->  SICINIUS. It shall be to him then as our good wills:
line 16750-->    A sure destruction.
line 16751-->  BRUTUS. So it must fall out
line 16752-->    To him or our authorities. For an end,
line 16753-->    We must suggest the people in what hatred
line 16754-->    He still hath held them; that to's power he would  
line 16755-->    Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and
line 16756-->    Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them
line 16757-->    In human action and capacity
line 16758-->    Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
line 16759-->    Than camels in their war, who have their provand
line 16760-->    Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
line 16761-->    For sinking under them.
line 16762-->  SICINIUS. This, as you say, suggested
line 16763-->    At some time when his soaring insolence
line 16764-->    Shall touch the people- which time shall not want,
line 16765-->    If he be put upon't, and that's as easy
line 16766-->    As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire
line 16767-->    To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
line 16768-->    Shall darken him for ever.
line 16769-->
line 16770-->                           Enter A MESSENGER
line 16771-->
line 16772-->  BRUTUS. What's the matter?
line 16773-->  MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
line 16774-->    That Marcius shall be consul.  
line 16775-->    I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
line 16776-->    The blind to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,
line 16777-->    Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
line 16778-->    Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended
line 16779-->    As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
line 16780-->    A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
line 16781-->    I never saw the like.
line 16782-->  BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol,
line 16783-->    And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
line 16784-->    But hearts for the event.
line 16785-->  SICINIUS. Have with you.                                Exeunt
line 16786-->
line 16787-->
line 16788-->
line 16789-->
line 16790-->SCENE II.
line 16791-->Rome. The Capitol
line 16792-->
line 16793-->Enter two OFFICERS, to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol
line 16794-->
line 16795-->  FIRST OFFICER. Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for
line 16796-->    consulships?
line 16797-->  SECOND OFFICER. Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one
line 16798-->    Coriolanus will carry it.
line 16799-->  FIRST OFFICER. That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and
line 16800-->    loves not the common people.
line 16801-->  SECOND OFFICER. Faith, there have been many great men that have
line 16802-->    flatter'd the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many
line 16803-->    that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they
line 16804-->    love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.
line 16805-->    Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
line 16806-->    hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
line 16807-->    disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
line 16808-->    see't.
line 16809-->  FIRST OFFICER. If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
line 16810-->    he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm;  
line 16811-->    but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
line 16812-->    render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
line 16813-->    him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and
line 16814-->    displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to
line 16815-->    flatter them for their love.
line 16816-->  SECOND OFFICER. He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his
line 16817-->    ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been
line 16818-->    supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further
line 16819-->    deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report; but
line 16820-->    he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in
line 16821-->    their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess
line 16822-->    so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise
line 16823-->    were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof
line 16824-->    and rebuke from every car that heard it.
line 16825-->  FIRST OFFICER. No more of him; he's a worthy man. Make way, they
line 16826-->    are coming.
line 16827-->
line 16828-->         A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
line 16829-->         OF THE PEOPLE, LICTORS before them; CORIOLANUS,
line 16830-->            MENENIUS, COMINIUS the Consul. SICINIUS and  
line 16831-->               BRUTUS take their places by themselves.
line 16832-->                         CORIOLANUS stands
line 16833-->
line 16834-->  MENENIUS. Having determin'd of the Volsces, and
line 16835-->    To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
line 16836-->    As the main point of this our after-meeting,
line 16837-->    To gratify his noble service that
line 16838-->    Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,
line 16839-->    Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
line 16840-->    The present consul and last general
line 16841-->    In our well-found successes to report
line 16842-->    A little of that worthy work perform'd
line 16843-->    By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom
line 16844-->    We met here both to thank and to remember
line 16845-->    With honours like himself.                 [CORIOLANUS sits]
line 16846-->  FIRST SENATOR. Speak, good Cominius.
line 16847-->    Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
line 16848-->    Rather our state's defective for requital
line 16849-->    Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' th' people,
line 16850-->    We do request your kindest ears; and, after,  
line 16851-->    Your loving motion toward the common body,
line 16852-->    To yield what passes here.
line 16853-->  SICINIUS. We are convented
line 16854-->    Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
line 16855-->    Inclinable to honour and advance
line 16856-->    The theme of our assembly.
line 16857-->  BRUTUS. Which the rather
line 16858-->    We shall be bless'd to do, if he remember
line 16859-->    A kinder value of the people than
line 16860-->    He hath hereto priz'd them at.
line 16861-->  MENENIUS. That's off, that's off;
line 16862-->    I would you rather had been silent. Please you
line 16863-->    To hear Cominius speak?
line 16864-->  BRUTUS. Most willingly.
line 16865-->    But yet my caution was more pertinent
line 16866-->    Than the rebuke you give it.
line 16867-->  MENENIUS. He loves your people;
line 16868-->    But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
line 16869-->    Worthy Cominius, speak.
line 16870-->                       [CORIOLANUS rises, and offers to go away]  
line 16871-->    Nay, keep your place.
line 16872-->  FIRST SENATOR. Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear
line 16873-->    What you have nobly done.
line 16874-->  CORIOLANUS. Your Honours' pardon.
line 16875-->    I had rather have my wounds to heal again
line 16876-->    Than hear say how I got them.
line 16877-->  BRUTUS. Sir, I hope
line 16878-->    My words disbench'd you not.
line 16879-->  CORIOLANUS. No, sir; yet oft,
line 16880-->    When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
line 16881-->    You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not. But your people,
line 16882-->    I love them as they weigh-
line 16883-->  MENENIUS. Pray now, sit down.
line 16884-->  CORIOLANUS. I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun
line 16885-->    When the alarum were struck than idly sit
line 16886-->    To hear my nothings monster'd.                          Exit
line 16887-->  MENENIUS. Masters of the people,
line 16888-->    Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-
line 16889-->    That's thousand to one good one- when you now see
line 16890-->    He had rather venture all his limbs for honour  
line 16891-->    Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
line 16892-->  COMINIUS. I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus
line 16893-->    Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
line 16894-->    That valour is the chiefest virtue and
line 16895-->    Most dignifies the haver. If it be,
line 16896-->    The man I speak of cannot in the world
line 16897-->    Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years,
line 16898-->    When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
line 16899-->    Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator,
line 16900-->    Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight
line 16901-->    When with his Amazonian chin he drove
line 16902-->    The bristled lips before him; he bestrid
line 16903-->    An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view
line 16904-->    Slew three opposers; Tarquin's self he met,
line 16905-->    And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,
line 16906-->    When he might act the woman in the scene,
line 16907-->    He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his meed
line 16908-->    Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
line 16909-->    Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea,
line 16910-->    And in the brunt of seventeen battles since  
line 16911-->    He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
line 16912-->    Before and in Corioli, let me say
line 16913-->    I cannot speak him home. He stopp'd the fliers,
line 16914-->    And by his rare example made the coward
line 16915-->    Turn terror into sport; as weeds before
line 16916-->    A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
line 16917-->    And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,
line 16918-->    Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
line 16919-->    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
line 16920-->    Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red
line 16921-->    The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted
line 16922-->    With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
line 16923-->    And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
line 16924-->    Corioli like a planet. Now all's his.
line 16925-->    When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
line 16926-->    His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit
line 16927-->    Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate,
line 16928-->    And to the battle came he; where he did
line 16929-->    Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
line 16930-->    'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd  
line 16931-->    Both field and city ours he never stood
line 16932-->    To ease his breast with panting.
line 16933-->  MENENIUS. Worthy man!
line 16934-->  FIRST SENATOR. He cannot but with measure fit the honours
line 16935-->    Which we devise him.
line 16936-->  COMINIUS. Our spoils he kick'd at,
line 16937-->    And look'd upon things precious as they were
line 16938-->    The common muck of the world. He covets less
line 16939-->    Than misery itself would give, rewards
line 16940-->    His deeds with doing them, and is content
line 16941-->    To spend the time to end it.
line 16942-->  MENENIUS. He's right noble;
line 16943-->    Let him be call'd for.
line 16944-->  FIRST SENATOR. Call Coriolanus.
line 16945-->    OFFICER. He doth appear.
line 16946-->
line 16947-->                            Re-enter CORIOLANUS
line 16948-->
line 16949-->  MENENIUS. The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd
line 16950-->    To make thee consul.  
line 16951-->  CORIOLANUS. I do owe them still
line 16952-->    My life and services.
line 16953-->  MENENIUS. It then remains
line 16954-->    That you do speak to the people.
line 16955-->  CORIOLANUS. I do beseech you
line 16956-->    Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot
line 16957-->    Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them
line 16958-->    For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage. Please you
line 16959-->    That I may pass this doing.
line 16960-->  SICINIUS. Sir, the people
line 16961-->    Must have their voices; neither will they bate
line 16962-->    One jot of ceremony.
line 16963-->  MENENIUS. Put them not to't.
line 16964-->    Pray you go fit you to the custom, and
line 16965-->    Take to you, as your predecessors have,
line 16966-->    Your honour with your form.
line 16967-->  CORIOLANUS. It is a part
line 16968-->    That I shall blush in acting, and might well
line 16969-->    Be taken from the people.
line 16970-->  BRUTUS. Mark you that?  
line 16971-->  CORIOLANUS. To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'
line 16972-->    Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide,
line 16973-->    As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
line 16974-->    Of their breath only!
line 16975-->  MENENIUS. Do not stand upon't.
line 16976-->    We recommend to you, Tribunes of the People,
line 16977-->    Our purpose to them; and to our noble consul
line 16978-->    Wish we all joy and honour.
line 16979-->  SENATORS. To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
line 16980-->                             [Flourish. Cornets. Then exeunt all
line 16981-->                                        but SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
line 16982-->  BRUTUS. You see how he intends to use the people.
line 16983-->  SICINIUS. May they perceive's intent! He will require them
line 16984-->    As if he did contemn what he requested
line 16985-->    Should be in them to give.
line 16986-->  BRUTUS. Come, we'll inform them
line 16987-->    Of our proceedings here. On th' market-place
line 16988-->    I know they do attend us.                             Exeunt
line 16989-->
line 16990-->
line 16991-->
line 16992-->
line 16993-->SCENE III.
line 16994-->Rome. The Forum
line 16995-->
line 16996-->Enter seven or eight citizens
line 16997-->
line 16998-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to
line 16999-->    deny him.
line 17000-->  SECOND CITIZEN. We may, sir, if we will.
line 17001-->  THIRD CITIZEN. We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
line 17002-->    power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds
line 17003-->    and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those
line 17004-->    wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we
line 17005-->    must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
line 17006-->    monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
line 17007-->    monster of the multitude; of the which we being members should
line 17008-->    bring ourselves to be monstrous members.
line 17009-->  FIRST CITIZEN. And to make us no better thought of, a little help
line 17010-->    will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck
line 17011-->    not to call us the many-headed multitude.
line 17012-->  THIRD CITIZEN. We have been call'd so of many; not that our heads
line 17013-->    are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our
line 17014-->    wits are so diversely colour'd; and truly I think if all our wits  
line 17015-->    were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north,
line 17016-->    south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to
line 17017-->    all the points o' th' compass.
line 17018-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
line 17019-->    fly?
line 17020-->  THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
line 17021-->    will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at
line 17022-->    liberty 'twould sure southward.
line 17023-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Why that way?
line 17024-->  THIRD CITIZEN. To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts
line 17025-->   melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for
line 17026-->    conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife.
line 17027-->  SECOND CITIZEN. YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you
line 17028-->    may.
line 17029-->  THIRD CITIZEN. Are you all resolv'd to give your voices? But that's
line 17030-->    no matter, the greater part carries it. I say, if he would
line 17031-->    incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.
line 17032-->
line 17033-->                Enter CORIOLANUS, in a gown of humility,
line 17034-->                               with MENENIUS  
line 17035-->
line 17036-->    Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour.
line 17037-->    We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he
line 17038-->    stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to make his
line 17039-->    requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single
line 17040-->    honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues;
line 17041-->    therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how you shall go by him.
line 17042-->  ALL. Content, content.                         Exeunt citizens
line 17043-->  MENENIUS. O sir, you are not right; have you not known
line 17044-->    The worthiest men have done't?
line 17045-->  CORIOLANUS. What must I say?
line 17046-->    'I pray, sir'- Plague upon't! I cannot bring
line 17047-->    My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds
line 17048-->    I got them in my country's service, when
line 17049-->    Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
line 17050-->    From th' noise of our own drums.'
line 17051-->  MENENIUS. O me, the gods!
line 17052-->    You must not speak of that. You must desire them
line 17053-->    To think upon you.
line 17054-->  CORIOLANUS. Think upon me? Hang 'em!  
line 17055-->    I would they would forget me, like the virtues
line 17056-->    Which our divines lose by 'em.
line 17057-->  MENENIUS. You'll mar all.
line 17058-->    I'll leave you. Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you,
line 17059-->    In wholesome manner.                                    Exit
line 17060-->
line 17061-->                       Re-enter three of the citizens
line 17062-->
line 17063-->  CORIOLANUS. Bid them wash their faces
line 17064-->    And keep their teeth clean. So, here comes a brace.
line 17065-->    You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.
line 17066-->  THIRD CITIZEN. We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
line 17067-->  CORIOLANUS. Mine own desert.
line 17068-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Your own desert?
line 17069-->  CORIOLANUS. Ay, not mine own desire.
line 17070-->  THIRD CITIZEN. How, not your own desire?
line 17071-->  CORIOLANUS. No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
line 17072-->    with begging.
line 17073-->  THIRD CITIZEN. YOU MUST think, if we give you anything, we hope to
line 17074-->    gain by you.  
line 17075-->  CORIOLANUS. Well then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship?
line 17076-->  FIRST CITIZEN. The price is to ask it kindly.
line 17077-->  CORIOLANUS. Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have wounds to show
line 17078-->    you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what
line 17079-->    say you?
line 17080-->  SECOND CITIZEN. You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
line 17081-->  CORIOLANUS. A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd.
line 17082-->    I have your alms. Adieu.
line 17083-->  THIRD CITIZEN. But this is something odd.
line 17084-->  SECOND CITIZEN. An 'twere to give again- but 'tis no matter.
line 17085-->                                       Exeunt the three citizens
line 17086-->
line 17087-->                      Re-enter two other citizens
line 17088-->
line 17089-->  CORIOLANUS. Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
line 17090-->    voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.
line 17091-->  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
line 17092-->    have not deserved nobly.
line 17093-->  CORIOLANUS. Your enigma?
line 17094-->  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have  
line 17095-->    been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common
line 17096-->    people.
line 17097-->  CORIOLANUS. You should account me the more virtuous, that I have
line 17098-->    not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn
line 17099-->    brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a
line 17100-->    condition they account gentle; and since the wisdom of their
line 17101-->    choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
line 17102-->    the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That
line 17103-->    is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man
line 17104-->    and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you I
line 17105-->    may be consul.
line 17106-->  FIFTH CITIZEN. We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
line 17107-->    you our voices heartily.
line 17108-->  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have received many wounds for your country.
line 17109-->  CORIOLANUS. I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
line 17110-->    will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.
line 17111-->  BOTH CITIZENS. The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
line 17112-->                                                 Exeunt citizens
line 17113-->  CORIOLANUS. Most sweet voices!
line 17114-->    Better it is to die, better to starve,  
line 17115-->    Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
line 17116-->    Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here
line 17117-->    To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
line 17118-->    Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't.
line 17119-->    What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
line 17120-->    The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
line 17121-->    And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
line 17122-->    For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,
line 17123-->    Let the high office and the honour go
line 17124-->    To one that would do thus. I am half through:
line 17125-->    The one part suffered, the other will I do.
line 17126-->
line 17127-->                      Re-enter three citizens more
line 17128-->
line 17129-->    Here come moe voices.
line 17130-->    Your voices. For your voices I have fought;
line 17131-->    Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear
line 17132-->    Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
line 17133-->    I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
line 17134-->    Done many things, some less, some more. Your voices?  
line 17135-->    Indeed, I would be consul.
line 17136-->  SIXTH CITIZEN. He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
line 17137-->    man's voice.
line 17138-->  SEVENTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him
line 17139-->    joy, and make him good friend to the people!
line 17140-->  ALL. Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
line 17141-->                                                 Exeunt citizens
line 17142-->  CORIOLANUS. Worthy voices!
line 17143-->
line 17144-->             Re-enter MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS
line 17145-->
line 17146-->  MENENIUS. You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes
line 17147-->    Endue you with the people's voice. Remains
line 17148-->    That, in th' official marks invested, you
line 17149-->    Anon do meet the Senate.
line 17150-->  CORIOLANUS. Is this done?
line 17151-->  SICINIUS. The custom of request you have discharg'd.
line 17152-->    The people do admit you, and are summon'd
line 17153-->    To meet anon, upon your approbation.
line 17154-->  CORIOLANUS. Where? At the Senate House?  
line 17155-->  SICINIUS. There, Coriolanus.
line 17156-->  CORIOLANUS. May I change these garments?
line 17157-->  SICINIUS. You may, sir.
line 17158-->  CORIOLANUS. That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,
line 17159-->    Repair to th' Senate House.
line 17160-->  MENENIUS. I'll keep you company. Will you along?
line 17161-->  BRUTUS. We stay here for the people.
line 17162-->  SICINIUS. Fare you well.
line 17163-->                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
line 17164-->    He has it now; and by his looks methinks
line 17165-->    'Tis warm at's heart.
line 17166-->  BRUTUS. With a proud heart he wore
line 17167-->    His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?
line 17168-->
line 17169-->                            Re-enter citizens
line 17170-->
line 17171-->  SICINIUS. How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
line 17172-->  FIRST CITIZEN. He has our voices, sir.
line 17173-->  BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
line 17174-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,  
line 17175-->    He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
line 17176-->  THIRD CITIZEN. Certainly;
line 17177-->    He flouted us downright.
line 17178-->  FIRST CITIZEN. No, 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us.
line 17179-->  SECOND CITIZEN. Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
line 17180-->    He us'd us scornfully. He should have show'd us
line 17181-->    His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.
line 17182-->  SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure.
line 17183-->  ALL. No, no; no man saw 'em.
line 17184-->  THIRD CITIZEN. He said he had wounds which he could show in
line 17185-->      private,
line 17186-->    And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
line 17187-->    'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom
line 17188-->    But by your voices will not so permit me;
line 17189-->    Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
line 17190-->    Here was 'I thank you for your voices. Thank you,
line 17191-->    Your most sweet voices. Now you have left your voices,
line 17192-->    I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
line 17193-->  SICINIUS. Why either were you ignorant to see't,
line 17194-->    Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness  
line 17195-->    To yield your voices?
line 17196-->  BRUTUS. Could you not have told him-
line 17197-->    As you were lesson'd- when he had no power
line 17198-->    But was a petty servant to the state,
line 17199-->    He was your enemy; ever spake against
line 17200-->    Your liberties and the charters that you bear
line 17201-->    I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving
line 17202-->    A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
line 17203-->    If he should still malignantly remain
line 17204-->    Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might
line 17205-->    Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
line 17206-->    That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
line 17207-->    Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
line 17208-->    Would think upon you for your voices, and
line 17209-->    Translate his malice towards you into love,
line 17210-->    Standing your friendly lord.
line 17211-->  SICINIUS. Thus to have said,
line 17212-->    As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
line 17213-->    And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
line 17214-->    Either his gracious promise, which you might,  
line 17215-->    As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
line 17216-->    Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
line 17217-->    Which easily endures not article
line 17218-->    Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,
line 17219-->    You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler
line 17220-->    And pass'd him unelected.
line 17221-->  BRUTUS. Did you perceive
line 17222-->    He did solicit you in free contempt
line 17223-->    When he did need your loves; and do you think
line 17224-->    That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
line 17225-->    When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
line 17226-->    No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry
line 17227-->    Against the rectorship of judgment?
line 17228-->  SICINIUS. Have you
line 17229-->    Ere now denied the asker, and now again,
line 17230-->    Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow
line 17231-->    Your su'd-for tongues?
line 17232-->  THIRD CITIZEN. He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.
line 17233-->  SECOND CITIZENS. And will deny him;
line 17234-->    I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.  
line 17235-->  FIRST CITIZEN. I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece
line 17236-->    'em.
line 17237-->  BRUTUS. Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
line 17238-->    They have chose a consul that will from them take
line 17239-->    Their liberties, make them of no more voice
line 17240-->    Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking
line 17241-->    As therefore kept to do so.
line 17242-->  SICINIUS. Let them assemble;
line 17243-->    And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
line 17244-->    Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
line 17245-->    And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
line 17246-->    With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
line 17247-->    How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
line 17248-->    Thinking upon his services, took from you
line 17249-->    Th' apprehension of his present portance,
line 17250-->    Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
line 17251-->    After the inveterate hate he bears you.
line 17252-->  BRUTUS. Lay
line 17253-->    A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
line 17254-->    No impediment between, but that you must  
line 17255-->    Cast your election on him.
line 17256-->  SICINIUS. Say you chose him
line 17257-->    More after our commandment than as guided
line 17258-->    By your own true affections; and that your minds,
line 17259-->    Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
line 17260-->    Than what you should, made you against the grain
line 17261-->    To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.
line 17262-->  BRUTUS. Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
line 17263-->    How youngly he began to serve his country,
line 17264-->    How long continued; and what stock he springs of-
line 17265-->    The noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came
line 17266-->    That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
line 17267-->    Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
line 17268-->    Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
line 17269-->    That our best water brought by conduits hither;
line 17270-->    And Censorinus, nobly named so,
line 17271-->    Twice being by the people chosen censor,
line 17272-->    Was his great ancestor.
line 17273-->  SICINIUS. One thus descended,
line 17274-->    That hath beside well in his person wrought  
line 17275-->    To be set high in place, we did commend
line 17276-->    To your remembrances; but you have found,
line 17277-->    Scaling his present bearing with his past,
line 17278-->    That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
line 17279-->    Your sudden approbation.
line 17280-->  BRUTUS. Say you ne'er had done't-
line 17281-->    Harp on that still- but by our putting on;
line 17282-->    And presently, when you have drawn your number,
line 17283-->    Repair to th' Capitol.
line 17284-->  CITIZENS. will will so; almost all
line 17285-->    Repent in their election.                   Exeunt plebeians
line 17286-->  BRUTUS. Let them go on;
line 17287-->    This mutiny were better put in hazard
line 17288-->    Than stay, past doubt, for greater.
line 17289-->    If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
line 17290-->    With their refusal, both observe and answer
line 17291-->    The vantage of his anger.
line 17292-->  SICINIUS. To th' Capitol, come.
line 17293-->    We will be there before the stream o' th' people;
line 17294-->    And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,  
line 17295-->    Which we have goaded onward.                          Exeunt
line 17296-->
line 17297-->
line 17298-->
line 17299-->
line 17300-->ACT III. SCENE I.
line 17301-->Rome. A street
line 17302-->
line 17303-->Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the GENTRY, COMINIUS,
line 17304-->TITUS LARTIUS, and other SENATORS
line 17305-->
line 17306-->  CORIOLANUS. Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?
line 17307-->  LARTIUS. He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd
line 17308-->    Our swifter composition.
line 17309-->  CORIOLANUS. So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
line 17310-->    Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
line 17311-->    Upon's again.
line 17312-->  COMINIUS. They are worn, Lord Consul, so
line 17313-->    That we shall hardly in our ages see
line 17314-->    Their banners wave again.
line 17315-->  CORIOLANUS. Saw you Aufidius?
line 17316-->  LARTIUS. On safeguard he came to me, and did curse
line 17317-->    Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
line 17318-->    Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium.
line 17319-->  CORIOLANUS. Spoke he of me?
line 17320-->  LARTIUS. He did, my lord.
line 17321-->  CORIOLANUS. How? What?  
line 17322-->  LARTIUS. How often he had met you, sword to sword;
line 17323-->    That of all things upon the earth he hated
line 17324-->    Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes
line 17325-->    To hopeless restitution, so he might
line 17326-->    Be call'd your vanquisher.
line 17327-->  CORIOLANUS. At Antium lives he?
line 17328-->  LARTIUS. At Antium.
line 17329-->  CORIOLANUS. I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
line 17330-->    To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
line 17331-->
line 17332-->                       Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
line 17333-->
line 17334-->    Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
line 17335-->    The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them,
line 17336-->    For they do prank them in authority,
line 17337-->    Against all noble sufferance.
line 17338-->  SICINIUS. Pass no further.
line 17339-->  CORIOLANUS. Ha! What is that?
line 17340-->  BRUTUS. It will be dangerous to go on- no further.
line 17341-->  CORIOLANUS. What makes this change?  
line 17342-->  MENENIUS. The matter?
line 17343-->  COMINIUS. Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
line 17344-->  BRUTUS. Cominius, no.
line 17345-->  CORIOLANUS. Have I had children's voices?
line 17346-->  FIRST SENATOR. Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.
line 17347-->  BRUTUS. The people are incens'd against him.
line 17348-->  SICINIUS. Stop,
line 17349-->    Or all will fall in broil.
line 17350-->  CORIOLANUS. Are these your herd?
line 17351-->    Must these have voices, that can yield them now
line 17352-->    And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
line 17353-->    You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
line 17354-->    Have you not set them on?
line 17355-->  MENENIUS. Be calm, be calm.
line 17356-->  CORIOLANUS. It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot,
line 17357-->    To curb the will of the nobility;
line 17358-->    Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
line 17359-->    Nor ever will be rul'd.
line 17360-->  BRUTUS. Call't not a plot.
line 17361-->    The people cry you mock'd them; and of late,  
line 17362-->    When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;
line 17363-->    Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
line 17364-->    Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
line 17365-->  CORIOLANUS. Why, this was known before.
line 17366-->  BRUTUS. Not to them all.
line 17367-->  CORIOLANUS. Have you inform'd them sithence?
line 17368-->  BRUTUS. How? I inform them!
line 17369-->  COMINIUS. You are like to do such business.
line 17370-->  BRUTUS. Not unlike
line 17371-->    Each way to better yours.
line 17372-->  CORIOLANUS. Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
line 17373-->    Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
line 17374-->    Your fellow tribune.
line 17375-->  SICINIUS. You show too much of that
line 17376-->    For which the people stir; if you will pass
line 17377-->    To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
line 17378-->    Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
line 17379-->    Or never be so noble as a consul,
line 17380-->    Nor yoke with him for tribune.
line 17381-->  MENENIUS. Let's be calm.  
line 17382-->  COMINIUS. The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring
line 17383-->    Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus
line 17384-->    Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
line 17385-->    I' th' plain way of his merit.
line 17386-->  CORIOLANUS. Tell me of corn!
line 17387-->    This was my speech, and I will speak't again-
line 17388-->  MENENIUS. Not now, not now.
line 17389-->  FIRST SENATOR. Not in this heat, sir, now.
line 17390-->  CORIOLANUS. Now, as I live, I will.
line 17391-->    My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
line 17392-->    For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them
line 17393-->    Regard me as I do not flatter, and
line 17394-->    Therein behold themselves. I say again,
line 17395-->    In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate
line 17396-->    The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
line 17397-->    Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
line 17398-->    By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
line 17399-->    Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
line 17400-->    Which they have given to beggars.
line 17401-->  MENENIUS. Well, no more.  
line 17402-->  FIRST SENATOR. No more words, we beseech you.
line 17403-->  CORIOLANUS. How? no more!
line 17404-->    As for my country I have shed my blood,
line 17405-->    Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
line 17406-->    Coin words till their decay against those measles
line 17407-->    Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
line 17408-->    The very way to catch them.
line 17409-->  BRUTUS. You speak o' th' people
line 17410-->    As if you were a god, to punish; not
line 17411-->    A man of their infirmity.
line 17412-->  SICINIUS. 'Twere well
line 17413-->    We let the people know't.
line 17414-->  MENENIUS. What, what? his choler?
line 17415-->  CORIOLANUS. Choler!
line 17416-->    Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
line 17417-->    By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
line 17418-->  SICINIUS. It is a mind
line 17419-->    That shall remain a poison where it is,
line 17420-->    Not poison any further.
line 17421-->  CORIOLANUS. Shall remain!  
line 17422-->    Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
line 17423-->    His absolute 'shall'?
line 17424-->  COMINIUS. 'Twas from the canon.
line 17425-->  CORIOLANUS. 'Shall'!
line 17426-->    O good but most unwise patricians! Why,
line 17427-->    You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
line 17428-->    Given Hydra here to choose an officer
line 17429-->    That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
line 17430-->    The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit
line 17431-->    To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
line 17432-->    And make your channel his? If he have power,
line 17433-->    Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
line 17434-->    Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
line 17435-->    Be not as common fools; if you are not,
line 17436-->    Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
line 17437-->    If they be senators; and they are no less,
line 17438-->    When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
line 17439-->    Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;
line 17440-->    And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
line 17441-->    His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench  
line 17442-->    Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,
line 17443-->    It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches
line 17444-->    To know, when two authorities are up,
line 17445-->    Neither supreme, how soon confusion
line 17446-->    May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
line 17447-->    The one by th' other.
line 17448-->  COMINIUS. Well, on to th' market-place.
line 17449-->  CORIOLANUS. Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
line 17450-->    The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd
line 17451-->    Sometime in Greece-
line 17452-->  MENENIUS. Well, well, no more of that.
line 17453-->  CORIOLANUS. Though there the people had more absolute pow'r-
line 17454-->    I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed
line 17455-->    The ruin of the state.
line 17456-->  BRUTUS. Why shall the people give
line 17457-->    One that speaks thus their voice?
line 17458-->  CORIOLANUS. I'll give my reasons,
line 17459-->    More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
line 17460-->    Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
line 17461-->    They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war  
line 17462-->    Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
line 17463-->    They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
line 17464-->    Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war,
line 17465-->    Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
line 17466-->    Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation
line 17467-->    Which they have often made against the Senate,
line 17468-->    All cause unborn, could never be the native
line 17469-->    Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
line 17470-->    How shall this bosom multiplied digest
line 17471-->    The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
line 17472-->    What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
line 17473-->    We are the greater poll, and in true fear
line 17474-->    They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
line 17475-->    The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
line 17476-->    Call our cares fears; which will in time
line 17477-->    Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in
line 17478-->    The crows to peck the eagles.
line 17479-->  MENENIUS. Come, enough.
line 17480-->  BRUTUS. Enough, with over measure.
line 17481-->  CORIOLANUS. No, take more.  
line 17482-->    What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
line 17483-->    Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
line 17484-->    Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
line 17485-->    Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,
line 17486-->    Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
line 17487-->    Of general ignorance- it must omit
line 17488-->    Real necessities, and give way the while
line 17489-->    To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows
line 17490-->    Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you-
line 17491-->    You that will be less fearful than discreet;
line 17492-->    That love the fundamental part of state
line 17493-->    More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer
line 17494-->    A noble life before a long, and wish
line 17495-->    To jump a body with a dangerous physic
line 17496-->    That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out
line 17497-->    The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
line 17498-->    The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
line 17499-->    Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state
line 17500-->    Of that integrity which should become't,
line 17501-->    Not having the power to do the good it would,  
line 17502-->    For th' ill which doth control't.
line 17503-->  BRUTUS. Has said enough.
line 17504-->  SICINIUS. Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
line 17505-->    As traitors do.
line 17506-->  CORIOLANUS. Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
line 17507-->    What should the people do with these bald tribunes,
line 17508-->    On whom depending, their obedience fails
line 17509-->    To the greater bench? In a rebellion,
line 17510-->    When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
line 17511-->    Then were they chosen; in a better hour
line 17512-->    Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
line 17513-->    And throw their power i' th' dust.
line 17514-->  BRUTUS. Manifest treason!
line 17515-->  SICINIUS. This a consul? No.
line 17516-->  BRUTUS. The aediles, ho!
line 17517-->
line 17518-->                           Enter an AEDILE
line 17519-->
line 17520-->    Let him be apprehended.
line 17521-->  SICINIUS. Go call the people,  [Exit AEDILE]  in whose name myself  
line 17522-->    Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
line 17523-->    A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
line 17524-->    And follow to thine answer.
line 17525-->  CORIOLANUS. Hence, old goat!
line 17526-->  PATRICIANS. We'll surety him.
line 17527-->  COMINIUS. Ag'd sir, hands off.
line 17528-->  CORIOLANUS. Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
line 17529-->    Out of thy garments.
line 17530-->  SICINIUS. Help, ye citizens!
line 17531-->
line 17532-->              Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES
line 17533-->
line 17534-->  MENENIUS. On both sides more respect.
line 17535-->  SICINIUS. Here's he that would take from you all your power.
line 17536-->  BRUTUS. Seize him, aediles.
line 17537-->    PLEBEIANS. Down with him! down with him!
line 17538-->  SECOND SENATOR. Weapons, weapons, weapons!
line 17539-->                              [They all bustle about CORIOLANUS]
line 17540-->  ALL. Tribunes! patricians! citizens! What, ho! Sicinius!
line 17541-->    Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!  
line 17542-->  PATRICIANS. Peace, peace, peace; stay, hold, peace!
line 17543-->  MENENIUS. What is about to be? I am out of breath;
line 17544-->    Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You tribunes
line 17545-->    To th' people- Coriolanus, patience!
line 17546-->    Speak, good Sicinius.
line 17547-->  SICINIUS. Hear me, people; peace!
line 17548-->  PLEBEIANS. Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.
line 17549-->  SICINIUS. You are at point to lose your liberties.
line 17550-->    Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
line 17551-->    Whom late you have nam'd for consul.
line 17552-->  MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie!
line 17553-->    This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
line 17554-->  FIRST SENATOR. To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.
line 17555-->  SICINIUS. What is the city but the people?
line 17556-->  PLEBEIANS. True,
line 17557-->    The people are the city.
line 17558-->  BRUTUS. By the consent of all we were establish'd
line 17559-->    The people's magistrates.
line 17560-->  PLEBEIANS. You so remain.
line 17561-->  MENENIUS. And so are like to do.  
line 17562-->  COMINIUS. That is the way to lay the city flat,
line 17563-->    To bring the roof to the foundation,
line 17564-->    And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
line 17565-->    In heaps and piles of ruin.
line 17566-->  SICINIUS. This deserves death.
line 17567-->  BRUTUS. Or let us stand to our authority
line 17568-->    Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
line 17569-->    Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power
line 17570-->    We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy
line 17571-->    Of present death.
line 17572-->  SICINIUS. Therefore lay hold of him;
line 17573-->    Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence
line 17574-->    Into destruction cast him.
line 17575-->  BRUTUS. AEdiles, seize him.
line 17576-->  PLEBEIANS. Yield, Marcius, yield.
line 17577-->  MENENIUS. Hear me one word; beseech you, Tribunes,
line 17578-->    Hear me but a word.
line 17579-->  AEDILES. Peace, peace!
line 17580-->  MENENIUS. Be that you seem, truly your country's friend,
line 17581-->    And temp'rately proceed to what you would  
line 17582-->    Thus violently redress.
line 17583-->  BRUTUS. Sir, those cold ways,
line 17584-->    That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
line 17585-->    Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him
line 17586-->    And bear him to the rock.
line 17587-->                                    [CORIOLANUS draws his sword]
line 17588-->  CORIOLANUS. No: I'll die here.
line 17589-->    There's some among you have beheld me fighting;
line 17590-->    Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
line 17591-->  MENENIUS. Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
line 17592-->  BRUTUS. Lay hands upon him.
line 17593-->  MENENIUS. Help Marcius, help,
line 17594-->    You that be noble; help him, young and old.
line 17595-->  PLEBEIANS. Down with him, down with him!
line 17596-->                      [In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES,
line 17597-->                                     and the people are beat in]
line 17598-->  MENENIUS. Go, get you to your house; be gone, away.
line 17599-->    All will be nought else.
line 17600-->  SECOND SENATOR. Get you gone.
line 17601-->  CORIOLANUS. Stand fast;  
line 17602-->    We have as many friends as enemies.
line 17603-->  MENENIUS. Shall it be put to that?
line 17604-->  FIRST SENATOR. The gods forbid!
line 17605-->    I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
line 17606-->    Leave us to cure this cause.
line 17607-->  MENENIUS. For 'tis a sore upon us
line 17608-->    You cannot tent yourself; be gone, beseech you.
line 17609-->  COMINIUS. Come, sir, along with us.
line 17610-->  CORIOLANUS. I would they were barbarians, as they are,
line 17611-->    Though in Rome litter'd; not Romans, as they are not,
line 17612-->    Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol.
line 17613-->  MENENIUS. Be gone.
line 17614-->    Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
line 17615-->    One time will owe another.
line 17616-->  CORIOLANUS. On fair ground
line 17617-->    I could beat forty of them.
line 17618-->  MENENIUS. I could myself
line 17619-->    Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes.
line 17620-->  COMINIUS. But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,
line 17621-->    And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands  
line 17622-->    Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
line 17623-->    Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
line 17624-->    Like interrupted waters, and o'erbear
line 17625-->    What they are us'd to bear.
line 17626-->  MENENIUS. Pray you be gone.
line 17627-->    I'll try whether my old wit be in request
line 17628-->    With those that have but little; this must be patch'd
line 17629-->    With cloth of any colour.
line 17630-->  COMINIUS. Nay, come away.
line 17631-->                     Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS, with others
line 17632-->  PATRICIANS. This man has marr'd his fortune.
line 17633-->  MENENIUS. His nature is too noble for the world:
line 17634-->    He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
line 17635-->    Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;
line 17636-->    What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
line 17637-->    And, being angry, does forget that ever
line 17638-->    He heard the name of death.                 [A noise within]
line 17639-->    Here's goodly work!
line 17640-->  PATRICIANS. I would they were a-bed.
line 17641-->  MENENIUS. I would they were in Tiber.  
line 17642-->    What the vengeance, could he not speak 'em fair?
line 17643-->
line 17644-->            Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, the rabble again
line 17645-->
line 17646-->  SICINIUS. Where is this viper
line 17647-->    That would depopulate the city and
line 17648-->    Be every man himself?
line 17649-->  MENENIUS. You worthy Tribunes-
line 17650-->  SICINIUS. He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
line 17651-->    With rigorous hands; he hath resisted law,
line 17652-->    And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
line 17653-->    Than the severity of the public power,
line 17654-->    Which he so sets at nought.
line 17655-->  FIRST CITIZEN. He shall well know
line 17656-->    The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
line 17657-->    And we their hands.
line 17658-->  PLEBEIANS. He shall, sure on't.
line 17659-->  MENENIUS. Sir, sir-
line 17660-->  SICINIUS. Peace!
line 17661-->  MENENIUS. Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt  
line 17662-->    With modest warrant.
line 17663-->  SICINIUS. Sir, how comes't that you
line 17664-->    Have holp to make this rescue?
line 17665-->  MENENIUS. Hear me speak.
line 17666-->    As I do know the consul's worthiness,
line 17667-->    So can I name his faults.
line 17668-->  SICINIUS. Consul! What consul?
line 17669-->  MENENIUS. The consul Coriolanus.
line 17670-->  BRUTUS. He consul!
line 17671-->  PLEBEIANS. No, no, no, no, no.
line 17672-->  MENENIUS. If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
line 17673-->    I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
line 17674-->    The which shall turn you to no further harm
line 17675-->    Than so much loss of time.
line 17676-->  SICINIUS. Speak briefly, then,
line 17677-->    For we are peremptory to dispatch
line 17678-->    This viperous traitor; to eject him hence
line 17679-->    Were but one danger, and to keep him here
line 17680-->    Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
line 17681-->    He dies to-night.  
line 17682-->  MENENIUS. Now the good gods forbid
line 17683-->    That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
line 17684-->    Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
line 17685-->    In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
line 17686-->    Should now eat up her own!
line 17687-->  SICINIUS. He's a disease that must be cut away.
line 17688-->  MENENIUS. O, he's a limb that has but a disease-
line 17689-->    Mortal, to cut it off: to cure it, easy.
line 17690-->    What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
line 17691-->    Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-
line 17692-->    Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
line 17693-->    By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country;
line 17694-->    And what is left, to lose it by his country
line 17695-->    Were to us all that do't and suffer it
line 17696-->    A brand to th' end o' th' world.
line 17697-->  SICINIUS. This is clean kam.
line 17698-->  BRUTUS. Merely awry. When he did love his country,
line 17699-->    It honour'd him.
line 17700-->  SICINIUS. The service of the foot,
line 17701-->    Being once gangren'd, is not then respected  
line 17702-->    For what before it was.
line 17703-->  BRUTUS. We'll hear no more.
line 17704-->    Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,
line 17705-->    Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
line 17706-->    Spread further.
line 17707-->  MENENIUS. One word more, one word
line 17708-->    This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
line 17709-->    The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,
line 17710-->    Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,
line 17711-->    Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out,
line 17712-->    And sack great Rome with Romans.
line 17713-->  BRUTUS. If it were so-
line 17714-->  SICINIUS. What do ye talk?
line 17715-->    Have we not had a taste of his obedience-
line 17716-->    Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!
line 17717-->  MENENIUS. Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars
line 17718-->    Since 'a could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
line 17719-->    In bolted language; meal and bran together
line 17720-->    He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
line 17721-->    I'll go to him and undertake to bring him  
line 17722-->    Where he shall answer by a lawful form,
line 17723-->    In peace, to his utmost peril.
line 17724-->  FIRST SENATOR. Noble Tribunes,
line 17725-->    It is the humane way; the other course
line 17726-->    Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
line 17727-->    Unknown to the beginning.
line 17728-->  SICINIUS. Noble Menenius,
line 17729-->    Be you then as the people's officer.
line 17730-->    Masters, lay down your weapons.
line 17731-->  BRUTUS. Go not home.
line 17732-->  SICINIUS. Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there;
line 17733-->    Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
line 17734-->    In our first way.
line 17735-->  MENENIUS. I'll bring him to you.
line 17736-->    [To the SENATORS]  Let me desire your company; he must come,
line 17737-->    Or what is worst will follow.
line 17738-->  FIRST SENATOR. Pray you let's to him.                   Exeunt
line 17739-->
line 17740-->
line 17741-->
line 17742-->
line 17743-->SCENE II.
line 17744-->Rome. The house of CORIOLANUS
line 17745-->
line 17746-->Enter CORIOLANUS with NOBLES
line 17747-->
line 17748-->  CORIOLANUS. Let them pull all about mine ears, present me
line 17749-->    Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels;
line 17750-->    Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
line 17751-->    That the precipitation might down stretch
line 17752-->    Below the beam of sight; yet will I still
line 17753-->    Be thus to them.
line 17754-->  FIRST PATRICIAN. You do the nobler.
line 17755-->  CORIOLANUS. I muse my mother
line 17756-->    Does not approve me further, who was wont
line 17757-->    To call them woollen vassals, things created
line 17758-->    To buy and sell with groats; to show bare heads
line 17759-->    In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder,
line 17760-->    When one but of my ordinance stood up
line 17761-->    To speak of peace or war.
line 17762-->
line 17763-->                          Enter VOLUMNIA
line 17764-->  
line 17765-->    I talk of you:
line 17766-->    Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me
line 17767-->    False to my nature? Rather say I play
line 17768-->    The man I am.
line 17769-->  VOLUMNIA. O, sir, sir, sir,
line 17770-->    I would have had you put your power well on
line 17771-->    Before you had worn it out.
line 17772-->  CORIOLANUS. Let go.
line 17773-->  VOLUMNIA. You might have been enough the man you are
line 17774-->    With striving less to be so; lesser had been
line 17775-->    The thwartings of your dispositions, if
line 17776-->    You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd,
line 17777-->    Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
line 17778-->  CORIOLANUS. Let them hang.
line 17779-->  VOLUMNIA. Ay, and burn too.
line 17780-->
line 17781-->                    Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS
line 17782-->
line 17783-->  MENENIUS. Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough;
line 17784-->    You must return and mend it.  
line 17785-->  FIRST SENATOR. There's no remedy,
line 17786-->    Unless, by not so doing, our good city
line 17787-->    Cleave in the midst and perish.
line 17788-->  VOLUMNIA. Pray be counsell'd;
line 17789-->    I have a heart as little apt as yours,
line 17790-->    But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
line 17791-->    To better vantage.
line 17792-->  MENENIUS. Well said, noble woman!
line 17793-->    Before he should thus stoop to th' herd, but that
line 17794-->    The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic
line 17795-->    For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
line 17796-->    Which I can scarcely bear.
line 17797-->  CORIOLANUS. What must I do?
line 17798-->  MENENIUS. Return to th' tribunes.
line 17799-->  CORIOLANUS. Well, what then, what then?
line 17800-->  MENENIUS. Repent what you have spoke.
line 17801-->  CORIOLANUS. For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
line 17802-->    Must I then do't to them?
line 17803-->  VOLUMNIA. You are too absolute;
line 17804-->    Though therein you can never be too noble  
line 17805-->    But when extremities speak. I have heard you say
line 17806-->    Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
line 17807-->    I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me
line 17808-->    In peace what each of them by th' other lose
line 17809-->    That they combine not there.
line 17810-->  CORIOLANUS. Tush, tush!
line 17811-->  MENENIUS. A good demand.
line 17812-->  VOLUMNIA. If it be honour in your wars to seem
line 17813-->    The same you are not, which for your best ends
line 17814-->    You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse
line 17815-->    That it shall hold companionship in peace
line 17816-->    With honour as in war; since that to both
line 17817-->    It stands in like request?
line 17818-->  CORIOLANUS. Why force you this?
line 17819-->  VOLUMNIA. Because that now it lies you on to speak
line 17820-->    To th' people, not by your own instruction,
line 17821-->    Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you,
line 17822-->    But with such words that are but roted in
line 17823-->    Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
line 17824-->    Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.  
line 17825-->    Now, this no more dishonours you at all
line 17826-->    Than to take in a town with gentle words,
line 17827-->    Which else would put you to your fortune and
line 17828-->    The hazard of much blood.
line 17829-->    I would dissemble with my nature where
line 17830-->    My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
line 17831-->    I should do so in honour. I am in this
line 17832-->    Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
line 17833-->    And you will rather show our general louts
line 17834-->    How you can frown, than spend a fawn upon 'em
line 17835-->    For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
line 17836-->    Of what that want might ruin.
line 17837-->  MENENIUS. Noble lady!
line 17838-->    Come, go with us, speak fair; you may salve so,
line 17839-->    Not what is dangerous present, but the los
line 17840-->    Of what is past.
line 17841-->  VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, My son,
line 17842-->    Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand;
line 17843-->    And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them-
line 17844-->    Thy knee bussing the stones- for in such busines  
line 17845-->    Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant
line 17846-->    More learned than the ears- waving thy head,
line 17847-->    Which often thus correcting thy-stout heart,
line 17848-->    Now humble as the ripest mulberry
line 17849-->    That will not hold the handling. Or say to them
line 17850-->    Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,
line 17851-->    Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
line 17852-->    Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim,
line 17853-->    In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame
line 17854-->    Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
line 17855-->    As thou hast power and person.
line 17856-->  MENENIUS. This but done
line 17857-->    Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
line 17858-->    For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
line 17859-->    As words to little purpose.
line 17860-->  VOLUMNIA. Prithee now,
line 17861-->    Go, and be rul'd; although I know thou hadst rather
line 17862-->    Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
line 17863-->    Than flatter him in a bower.
line 17864-->  
line 17865-->                           Enter COMINIUS
line 17866-->
line 17867-->    Here is Cominius.
line 17868-->  COMINIUS. I have been i' th' market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit
line 17869-->    You make strong party, or defend yourself
line 17870-->    By calmness or by absence; all's in anger.
line 17871-->  MENENIUS. Only fair speech.
line 17872-->  COMINIUS. I think 'twill serve, if he
line 17873-->    Can thereto frame his spirit.
line 17874-->  VOLUMNIA. He must and will.
line 17875-->    Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
line 17876-->  CORIOLANUS. Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce? Must I
line 17877-->    With my base tongue give to my noble heart
line 17878-->    A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
line 17879-->    Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
line 17880-->    This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it,
line 17881-->    And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place!
line 17882-->    You have put me now to such a part which never
line 17883-->    I shall discharge to th' life.
line 17884-->  COMINIUS. Come, come, we'll prompt you.  
line 17885-->  VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
line 17886-->    My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
line 17887-->    To have my praise for this, perform a part
line 17888-->    Thou hast not done before.
line 17889-->  CORIOLANUS. Well, I must do't.
line 17890-->    Away, my disposition, and possess me
line 17891-->    Some harlot's spirit! My throat of war be turn'd,
line 17892-->    Which quier'd with my drum, into a pipe
line 17893-->    Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
line 17894-->    That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves
line 17895-->    Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
line 17896-->    The glasses of my sight! A beggar's tongue
line 17897-->    Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
line 17898-->    Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
line 17899-->    That hath receiv'd an alms! I will not do't,
line 17900-->    Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth,
line 17901-->    And by my body's action teach my mind
line 17902-->    A most inherent baseness.
line 17903-->  VOLUMNIA. At thy choice, then.
line 17904-->    To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour  
line 17905-->    Than thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let
line 17906-->    Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
line 17907-->    Thy dangerous stoutness; for I mock at death
line 17908-->    With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.
line 17909-->    Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me;
line 17910-->    But owe thy pride thyself.
line 17911-->  CORIOLANUS. Pray be content.
line 17912-->    Mother, I am going to the market-place;
line 17913-->    Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
line 17914-->    Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov'd
line 17915-->    Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.
line 17916-->    Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,
line 17917-->    Or never trust to what my tongue can do
line 17918-->    I' th' way of flattery further.
line 17919-->  VOLUMNIA. Do your will.                                   Exit
line 17920-->  COMINIUS. Away! The tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself
line 17921-->    To answer mildly; for they are prepar'd
line 17922-->    With accusations, as I hear, more strong
line 17923-->    Than are upon you yet.
line 17924-->  CORIOLANUS. The word is 'mildly.' Pray you let us go.  
line 17925-->    Let them accuse me by invention; I
line 17926-->    Will answer in mine honour.
line 17927-->  MENENIUS. Ay, but mildly.
line 17928-->  CORIOLANUS. Well, mildly be it then- mildly.            Exeunt
line 17929-->
line 17930-->
line 17931-->
line 17932-->
line 17933-->SCENE III.
line 17934-->Rome. The Forum
line 17935-->
line 17936-->Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
line 17937-->
line 17938-->  BRUTUS. In this point charge him home, that he affects
line 17939-->    Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,
line 17940-->    Enforce him with his envy to the people,
line 17941-->    And that the spoil got on the Antiates
line 17942-->    Was ne'er distributed.
line 17943-->
line 17944-->                           Enter an AEDILE
line 17945-->
line 17946-->    What, will he come?
line 17947-->  AEDILE. He's coming.
line 17948-->  BRUTUS. How accompanied?
line 17949-->  AEDILE. With old Menenius, and those senators
line 17950-->    That always favour'd him.
line 17951-->  SICINIUS. Have you a catalogue
line 17952-->    Of all the voices that we have procur'd,
line 17953-->    Set down by th' poll?
line 17954-->  AEDILE. I have; 'tis ready.  
line 17955-->  SICINIUS. Have you corrected them by tribes?
line 17956-->  AEDILE. I have.
line 17957-->  SICINIUS. Assemble presently the people hither;
line 17958-->    And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
line 17959-->    I' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either
line 17960-->    For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
line 17961-->    If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if death, cry 'Death!'
line 17962-->    Insisting on the old prerogative
line 17963-->    And power i' th' truth o' th' cause.
line 17964-->  AEDILE. I shall inform them.
line 17965-->  BRUTUS. And when such time they have begun to cry,
line 17966-->    Let them not cease, but with a din confus'd
line 17967-->    Enforce the present execution
line 17968-->    Of what we chance to sentence.
line 17969-->  AEDILE. Very well.
line 17970-->  SICINIUS. Make them be strong, and ready for this hint,
line 17971-->    When we shall hap to give't them.
line 17972-->  BRUTUS. Go about it.                               Exit AEDILE
line 17973-->    Put him to choler straight. He hath been us'd
line 17974-->    Ever to conquer, and to have his worth  
line 17975-->    Of contradiction; being once chaf'd, he cannot
line 17976-->    Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
line 17977-->    What's in his heart, and that is there which looks
line 17978-->    With us to break his neck.
line 17979-->
line 17980-->          Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS and COMINIUS, with others
line 17981-->
line 17982-->  SICINIUS. Well, here he comes.
line 17983-->  MENENIUS. Calmly, I do beseech you.
line 17984-->  CORIOLANUS. Ay, as an ostler, that for th' poorest piece
line 17985-->    Will bear the knave by th' volume. Th' honour'd gods
line 17986-->    Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
line 17987-->    Supplied with worthy men! plant love among's!
line 17988-->    Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
line 17989-->    And not our streets with war!
line 17990-->  FIRST SENATOR. Amen, amen!
line 17991-->  MENENIUS. A noble wish.
line 17992-->
line 17993-->                  Re-enter the.AEDILE,with the plebeians
line 17994-->  
line 17995-->  SICINIUS. Draw near, ye people.
line 17996-->  AEDILE. List to your tribunes. Audience! peace, I say!
line 17997-->  CORIOLANUS. First, hear me speak.
line 17998-->  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, say. Peace, ho!
line 17999-->  CORIOLANUS. Shall I be charg'd no further than this present?
line 18000-->    Must all determine here?
line 18001-->  SICINIUS. I do demand,
line 18002-->    If you submit you to the people's voices,
line 18003-->    Allow their officers, and are content
line 18004-->    To suffer lawful censure for such faults
line 18005-->    As shall be prov'd upon you.
line 18006-->  CORIOLANUS. I am content.
line 18007-->  MENENIUS. Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
line 18008-->    The warlike service he has done, consider; think
line 18009-->    Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
line 18010-->    Like graves i' th' holy churchyard.
line 18011-->  CORIOLANUS. Scratches with briers,
line 18012-->    Scars to move laughter only.
line 18013-->  MENENIUS. Consider further,
line 18014-->    That when he speaks not like a citizen,  
line 18015-->    You find him like a soldier; do not take
line 18016-->    His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
line 18017-->    But, as I say, such as become a soldier
line 18018-->    Rather than envy you.
line 18019-->  COMINIUS. Well, well! No more.
line 18020-->  CORIOLANUS. What is the matter,
line 18021-->    That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
line 18022-->    I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
line 18023-->    You take it off again?
line 18024-->  SICINIUS. Answer to us.
line 18025-->  CORIOLANUS. Say then; 'tis true, I ought so.
line 18026-->  SICINIUS. We charge you that you have contriv'd to take
line 18027-->    From Rome all season'd office, and to wind
line 18028-->    Yourself into a power tyrannical;
line 18029-->    For which you are a traitor to the people.
line 18030-->  CORIOLANUS. How- traitor?
line 18031-->  MENENIUS. Nay, temperately! Your promise.
line 18032-->  CORIOLANUS. The fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people!
line 18033-->    Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
line 18034-->    Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,  
line 18035-->    In thy hands clutch'd as many millions, in
line 18036-->    Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
line 18037-->    'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
line 18038-->    As I do pray the gods.
line 18039-->  SICINIUS. Mark you this, people?
line 18040-->  PLEBEIANS. To th' rock, to th' rock, with him!
line 18041-->  SICINIUS. Peace!
line 18042-->    We need not put new matter to his charge.
line 18043-->    What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
line 18044-->    Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
line 18045-->    Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
line 18046-->    Those whose great power must try him- even this,
line 18047-->    So criminal and in such capital kind,
line 18048-->    Deserves th' extremest death.
line 18049-->  BRUTUS. But since he hath
line 18050-->    Serv'd well for Rome-
line 18051-->  CORIOLANUS. What do you prate of service?
line 18052-->  BRUTUS. I talk of that that know it.
line 18053-->  CORIOLANUS. You!
line 18054-->  MENENIUS. Is this the promise that you made your mother?  
line 18055-->  COMINIUS. Know, I pray you-
line 18056-->  CORIOLANUS. I'll know no further.
line 18057-->    Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
line 18058-->    Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger
line 18059-->    But with a grain a day, I would not buy
line 18060-->    Their mercy at the price of one fair word,
line 18061-->    Nor check my courage for what they can give,
line 18062-->    To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
line 18063-->  SICINIUS. For that he has-
line 18064-->    As much as in him lies- from time to time
line 18065-->    Envied against the people, seeking means
line 18066-->    To pluck away their power; as now at last
line 18067-->    Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
line 18068-->    Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
line 18069-->    That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people,
line 18070-->    And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
line 18071-->    Ev'n from this instant, banish him our city,
line 18072-->    In peril of precipitation
line 18073-->    From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
line 18074-->    To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name,  
line 18075-->    I say it shall be so.
line 18076-->  PLEBEIANS. It shall be so, it shall be so! Let him away!
line 18077-->    He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
line 18078-->  COMINIUS. Hear me, my masters and my common friends-
line 18079-->  SICINIUS. He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.
line 18080-->  COMINIUS. Let me speak.
line 18081-->    I have been consul, and can show for Rome
line 18082-->    Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
line 18083-->    My country's good with a respect more tender,
line 18084-->    More holy and profound, than mine own life,
line 18085-->    My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase
line 18086-->    And treasure of my loins. Then if I would
line 18087-->    Speak that-
line 18088-->  SICINIUS. We know your drift. Speak what?
line 18089-->  BRUTUS. There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
line 18090-->    As enemy to the people and his country.
line 18091-->    It shall be so.
line 18092-->  PLEBEIANS. It shall be so, it shall be so.
line 18093-->  CORIOLANUS. YOU common cry of curs, whose breath I hate
line 18094-->    As reek o' th' rotten fens, whose loves I prize  
line 18095-->    As the dead carcasses of unburied men
line 18096-->    That do corrupt my air- I banish you.
line 18097-->    And here remain with your uncertainty!
line 18098-->    Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts;
line 18099-->    Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
line 18100-->    Fan you into despair! Have the power still
line 18101-->    To banish your defenders, till at length
line 18102-->    Your ignorance- which finds not till it feels,
line 18103-->    Making but reservation of yourselves
line 18104-->    Still your own foes- deliver you
line 18105-->    As most abated captives to some nation
line 18106-->    That won you without blows! Despising
line 18107-->    For you the city, thus I turn my back;
line 18108-->    There is a world elsewhere.
line 18109-->                                              Exeunt CORIOLANUS,
line 18110-->                   COMINIUS, MENENIUS, with the other PATRICIANS
line 18111-->  AEDILE. The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
line 18112-->                        [They all shout and throw up their caps]
line 18113-->  PLEBEIANS. Our enemy is banish'd, he is gone! Hoo-oo!
line 18114-->  SICINIUS. Go see him out at gates, and follow him,  
line 18115-->    As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;
line 18116-->    Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard
line 18117-->    Attend us through the city.
line 18118-->  PLEBEIANS. Come, come, let's see him out at gates; come!
line 18119-->    The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.           Exeunt
line 18120-->

line 18135-->ACT IV. SCENE I.
line 18136-->Rome. Before a gate of the city
line 18137-->
line 18138-->Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS,
line 18139-->with the young NOBILITY of Rome
line 18140-->
line 18141-->  CORIOLANUS. Come, leave your tears; a brief farewell. The beast
line 18142-->    With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
line 18143-->    Where is your ancient courage? You were us'd
line 18144-->    To say extremities was the trier of spirits;
line 18145-->    That common chances common men could bear;
line 18146-->    That when the sea was calm all boats alike
line 18147-->    Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
line 18148-->    When most struck home, being gentle wounded craves
line 18149-->    A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
line 18150-->    With precepts that would make invincible
line 18151-->    The heart that conn'd them.
line 18152-->  VIRGILIA. O heavens! O heavens!
line 18153-->  CORIOLANUS. Nay, I prithee, woman-
line 18154-->  VOLUMNIA. Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
line 18155-->    And occupations perish!
line 18156-->  CORIOLANUS. What, what, what!  
line 18157-->    I shall be lov'd when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,
line 18158-->    Resume that spirit when you were wont to say,
line 18159-->    If you had been the wife of Hercules,
line 18160-->    Six of his labours you'd have done, and sav'd
line 18161-->    Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
line 18162-->    Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother.
line 18163-->    I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
line 18164-->    Thy tears are salter than a younger man's
line 18165-->    And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime General,
line 18166-->    I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
line 18167-->    Heart-hard'ning spectacles; tell these sad women
line 18168-->    'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
line 18169-->    As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
line 18170-->    My hazards still have been your solace; and
line 18171-->    Believe't not lightly- though I go alone,
line 18172-->    Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
line 18173-->    Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen- your son
line 18174-->    Will or exceed the common or be caught
line 18175-->    With cautelous baits and practice.
line 18176-->  VOLUMNIA. My first son,  
line 18177-->    Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
line 18178-->    With thee awhile; determine on some course
line 18179-->    More than a wild exposture to each chance
line 18180-->    That starts i' th' way before thee.
line 18181-->  VIRGILIA. O the gods!
line 18182-->  COMINIUS. I'll follow thee a month, devise with the
line 18183-->    Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us,
line 18184-->    And we of thee; so, if the time thrust forth
line 18185-->    A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
line 18186-->    O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
line 18187-->    And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
line 18188-->    I' th' absence of the needer.
line 18189-->  CORIOLANUS. Fare ye well;
line 18190-->    Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full
line 18191-->    Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one
line 18192-->    That's yet unbruis'd; bring me but out at gate.
line 18193-->    Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
line 18194-->    My friends of noble touch; when I am forth,
line 18195-->    Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you come.
line 18196-->    While I remain above the ground you shall  
line 18197-->    Hear from me still, and never of me aught
line 18198-->    But what is like me formerly.
line 18199-->  MENENIUS. That's worthily
line 18200-->    As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
line 18201-->    If I could shake off but one seven years
line 18202-->    From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
line 18203-->    I'd with thee every foot.
line 18204-->  CORIOLANUS. Give me thy hand.
line 18205-->    Come.                                                 Exeunt

line 18210-->SCENE II.
line 18211-->Rome. A street near the gate
line 18212-->
line 18213-->Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS with the AEDILE
line 18214-->
line 18215-->  SICINIUS. Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
line 18216-->    The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
line 18217-->    In his behalf.
line 18218-->  BRUTUS. Now we have shown our power,
line 18219-->    Let us seem humbler after it is done
line 18220-->    Than when it was a-doing.
line 18221-->  SICINIUS. Bid them home.
line 18222-->    Say their great enemy is gone, and they
line 18223-->    Stand in their ancient strength.
line 18224-->  BRUTUS. Dismiss them home.                         Exit AEDILE
line 18225-->    Here comes his mother.
line 18226-->
line 18227-->                   Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS
line 18228-->
line 18229-->  SICINIUS. Let's not meet her.
line 18230-->  BRUTUS. Why?  
line 18231-->  SICINIUS. They say she's mad.
line 18232-->  BRUTUS. They have ta'en note of us; keep on your way.
line 18233-->  VOLUMNIA. O, Y'are well met; th' hoarded plague o' th' gods
line 18234-->    Requite your love!
line 18235-->  MENENIUS. Peace, peace, be not so loud.
line 18236-->  VOLUMNIA. If that I could for weeping, you should hear-
line 18237-->    Nay, and you shall hear some.  [To BRUTUS] Will you be gone?
line 18238-->  VIRGILIA.  [To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too. I would I had the
line 18239-->      power
line 18240-->    To say so to my husband.
line 18241-->  SICINIUS. Are you mankind?
line 18242-->  VOLUMNIA. Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this, fool:
line 18243-->    Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
line 18244-->    To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
line 18245-->    Than thou hast spoken words?
line 18246-->  SICINIUS. O blessed heavens!
line 18247-->  VOLUMNIA. Moe noble blows than ever thou wise words;
line 18248-->    And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what- yet go!
line 18249-->    Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son
line 18250-->    Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,  
line 18251-->    His good sword in his hand.
line 18252-->  SICINIUS. What then?
line 18253-->  VIRGILIA. What then!
line 18254-->    He'd make an end of thy posterity.
line 18255-->  VOLUMNIA. Bastards and all.
line 18256-->    Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
line 18257-->  MENENIUS. Come, come, peace.
line 18258-->  SICINIUS. I would he had continued to his country
line 18259-->    As he began, and not unknit himself
line 18260-->    The noble knot he made.
line 18261-->  BRUTUS. I would he had.
line 18262-->  VOLUMNIA. 'I would he had!' 'Twas you incens'd the rabble-
line 18263-->    Cats that can judge as fitly of his worth
line 18264-->    As I can of those mysteries which heaven
line 18265-->    Will not have earth to know.
line 18266-->  BRUTUS. Pray, let's go.
line 18267-->  VOLUMNIA. Now, pray, sir, get you gone;
line 18268-->    You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:
line 18269-->    As far as doth the Capitol exceed
line 18270-->    The meanest house in Rome, so far my son-  
line 18271-->    This lady's husband here, this, do you see?-
line 18272-->    Whom you have banish'd does exceed you an.
line 18273-->  BRUTUS. Well, well, we'll leave you.
line 18274-->  SICINIUS. Why stay we to be baited
line 18275-->    With one that wants her wits?                Exeunt TRIBUNES
line 18276-->  VOLUMNIA. Take my prayers with you.
line 18277-->    I would the gods had nothing else to do
line 18278-->    But to confirm my curses. Could I meet 'em
line 18279-->    But once a day, it would unclog my heart
line 18280-->    Of what lies heavy to't.
line 18281-->  MENENIUS. You have told them home,
line 18282-->    And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
line 18283-->  VOLUMNIA. Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
line 18284-->    And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go.
line 18285-->    Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
line 18286-->    In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
line 18287-->                                    Exeunt VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA
line 18288-->  MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie!                                  Exit

line 18293-->SCENE III.
line 18294-->A highway between Rome and Antium
line 18295-->
line 18296-->Enter a ROMAN and a VOLSCE, meeting
line 18297-->
line 18298-->  ROMAN. I know you well, sir, and you know me; your name, I think,
line 18299-->    is Adrian.
line 18300-->  VOLSCE. It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.
line 18301-->  ROMAN. I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em.
line 18302-->    Know you me yet?
line 18303-->  VOLSCE. Nicanor? No!
line 18304-->  ROMAN. The same, sir.
line 18305-->  VOLSCE. YOU had more beard when I last saw you, but your favour is
line 18306-->    well appear'd by your tongue. What's the news in Rome? I have a
line 18307-->    note from the Volscian state, to find you out there. You have
line 18308-->    well saved me a day's journey.
line 18309-->  ROMAN. There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people
line 18310-->    against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
line 18311-->  VOLSCE. Hath been! Is it ended, then? Our state thinks not so; they
line 18312-->    are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in
line 18313-->    the heat of their division.
line 18314-->  ROMAN. The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make  
line 18315-->    it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment
line 18316-->    of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
line 18317-->    all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes
line 18318-->    for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature
line 18319-->    for the violent breaking out.
line 18320-->  VOLSCE. Coriolanus banish'd!
line 18321-->  ROMAN. Banish'd, sir.
line 18322-->  VOLSCE. You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
line 18323-->  ROMAN. The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said the
line 18324-->    fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fall'n out
line 18325-->    with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in
line 18326-->    these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no
line 18327-->    request of his country.
line 18328-->  VOLSCE. He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus accidentally to
line 18329-->    encounter you; you have ended my business, and I will merrily
line 18330-->    accompany you home.
line 18331-->  ROMAN. I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things
line 18332-->    from Rome, all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you
line 18333-->    an army ready, say you?
line 18334-->  VOLSCE. A most royal one: the centurions and their charges,  
line 18335-->    distinctly billeted, already in th' entertainment, and to be on
line 18336-->    foot at an hour's warning.
line 18337-->  ROMAN. I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I
line 18338-->    think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily
line 18339-->    well met, and most glad of your company.
line 18340-->  VOLSCE. You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be
line 18341-->    glad of yours.
line 18342-->  ROMAN. Well, let us go together.
line 18343-->

line 18347-->SCENE IV.
line 18348-->Antium. Before AUFIDIUS' house
line 18349-->
line 18350-->Enter CORIOLANUS, in mean apparel, disguis'd and muffled
line 18351-->
line 18352-->  CORIOLANUS. A goodly city is this Antium. City,
line 18353-->    'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
line 18354-->    Of these fair edifices fore my wars
line 18355-->    Have I heard groan and drop. Then know me not.
line 18356-->    Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones,
line 18357-->    In puny battle slay me.
line 18358-->
line 18359-->                           Enter A CITIZEN
line 18360-->
line 18361-->    Save you, sir.
line 18362-->  CITIZEN. And you.
line 18363-->  CORIOLANUS. Direct me, if it be your will,
line 18364-->    Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?
line 18365-->  CITIZEN. He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
line 18366-->    At his house this night.
line 18367-->  CORIOLANUS. Which is his house, beseech you?
line 18368-->  CITIZEN. This here before you.  
line 18369-->  CORIOLANUS. Thank you, sir; farewell.             Exit CITIZEN
line 18370-->    O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
line 18371-->    Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart,
line 18372-->    Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise
line 18373-->    Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love,
line 18374-->    Unseparable, shall within this hour,
line 18375-->    On a dissension of a doit, break out
line 18376-->    To bitterest enmity; so fellest foes,
line 18377-->    Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
line 18378-->    To take the one the other, by some chance,
line 18379-->    Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
line 18380-->    And interjoin their issues. So with me:
line 18381-->    My birthplace hate I, and my love's upon
line 18382-->    This enemy town. I'll enter. If he slay me,
line 18383-->    He does fair justice: if he give me way,
line 18384-->    I'll do his country service.

line 18391-->
line 18392-->Music plays. Enter A SERVINGMAN
line 18393-->
line 18394-->  FIRST SERVANT. Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our
line 18395-->    fellows are asleep.                                     Exit
line 18396-->
line 18397-->                     Enter another SERVINGMAN
line 18398-->
line 18399-->  SECOND SERVANT.Where's Cotus? My master calls for him.
line 18400-->    Cotus!                                                  Exit
line 18401-->
line 18402-->                       Enter CORIOLANUS
line 18403-->
line 18404-->  CORIOLANUS. A goodly house. The feast smells well, but I
line 18405-->    Appear not like a guest.
line 18406-->
line 18407-->                 Re-enter the first SERVINGMAN
line 18408-->
line 18409-->  FIRST SERVANT. What would you have, friend?
line 18410-->    Whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray go to the door.  
line 18411--> Exit
line 18412-->  CORIOLANUS. I have deserv'd no better entertainment
line 18413-->    In being Coriolanus.
line 18414-->
line 18415-->                   Re-enter second SERVINGMAN
line 18416-->
line 18417-->  SECOND SERVANT. Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
line 18418-->    head that he gives entrance to such companions? Pray get you out.
line 18419-->  CORIOLANUS. Away!
line 18420-->  SECOND SERVANT. Away? Get you away.
line 18421-->  CORIOLANUS. Now th' art troublesome.
line 18422-->  SECOND SERVANT. Are you so brave? I'll have you talk'd with anon.
line 18423-->
line 18424-->          Enter a third SERVINGMAN. The first meets him
line 18425-->
line 18426-->  THIRD SERVANT. What fellow's this?
line 18427-->  FIRST SERVANT. A strange one as ever I look'd on. I cannot get him
line 18428-->    out o' th' house. Prithee call my master to him.
line 18429-->  THIRD SERVANT. What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you avoid the
line 18430-->    house.  
line 18431-->  CORIOLANUS. Let me but stand- I will not hurt your hearth.
line 18432-->  THIRD SERVANT. What are you?
line 18433-->  CORIOLANUS. A gentleman.
line 18434-->  THIRD SERVANT. A marv'llous poor one.
line 18435-->  CORIOLANUS. True, so I am.
line 18436-->  THIRD SERVANT. Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
line 18437-->    station; here's no place for you. Pray you avoid. Come.
line 18438-->  CORIOLANUS. Follow your function, go and batten on cold bits.
line 18439-->                                      [Pushes him away from him]
line 18440-->  THIRD SERVANT. What, you will not? Prithee tell my master what a
line 18441-->    strange guest he has here.
line 18442-->  SECOND SERVANT. And I shall.                              Exit
line 18443-->  THIRD SERVANT. Where dwell'st thou?
line 18444-->  CORIOLANUS. Under the canopy.
line 18445-->  THIRD SERVANT. Under the canopy?
line 18446-->  CORIOLANUS. Ay.
line 18447-->  THIRD SERVANT. Where's that?
line 18448-->  CORIOLANUS. I' th' city of kites and crows.
line 18449-->  THIRD SERVANT. I' th' city of kites and crows!
line 18450-->    What an ass it is! Then thou dwell'st with daws too?  
line 18451-->  CORIOLANUS. No, I serve not thy master.
line 18452-->  THIRD SERVANT. How, sir! Do you meddle with my master?
line 18453-->  CORIOLANUS. Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
line 18454-->    mistress. Thou prat'st and prat'st; serve with thy trencher;
line 18455-->    hence!                                      [Beats him away]
line 18456-->
line 18457-->             Enter AUFIDIUS with the second SERVINGMAN
line 18458-->
line 18459-->  AUFIDIUS. Where is this fellow?
line 18460-->  SECOND SERVANT. Here, sir; I'd have beaten him like a dog, but for
line 18461-->    disturbing the lords within.
line 18462-->  AUFIDIUS. Whence com'st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name?
line 18463-->    Why speak'st not? Speak, man. What's thy name?
line 18464-->  CORIOLANUS.  [Unmuffling]  If, Tullus,
line 18465-->    Not yet thou know'st me, and, seeing me, dost not
line 18466-->    Think me for the man I am, necessity
line 18467-->    Commands me name myself.
line 18468-->  AUFIDIUS. What is thy name?
line 18469-->  CORIOLANUS. A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
line 18470-->    And harsh in sound to thine.  
line 18471-->  AUFIDIUS. Say, what's thy name?
line 18472-->    Thou has a grim appearance, and thy face
line 18473-->    Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn,
line 18474-->    Thou show'st a noble vessel. What's thy name?
line 18475-->  CORIOLANUS. Prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet?
line 18476-->  AUFIDIUS. I know thee not. Thy name?
line 18477-->  CORIOLANUS. My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
line 18478-->    To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,
line 18479-->    Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
line 18480-->    My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,
line 18481-->    The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
line 18482-->    Shed for my thankless country, are requited
line 18483-->    But with that surname- a good memory
line 18484-->    And witness of the malice and displeasure
line 18485-->    Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;
line 18486-->    The cruelty and envy of the people,
line 18487-->    Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
line 18488-->    Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,
line 18489-->    An suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be
line 18490-->    Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity  
line 18491-->    Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,
line 18492-->    Mistake me not, to save my life; for if
line 18493-->    I had fear'd death, of all the men i' th' world
line 18494-->    I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,
line 18495-->    To be full quit of those my banishers,
line 18496-->    Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
line 18497-->    A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
line 18498-->    Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
line 18499-->    Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight
line 18500-->    And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it
line 18501-->    That my revengeful services may prove
line 18502-->    As benefits to thee; for I will fight
line 18503-->    Against my cank'red country with the spleen
line 18504-->    Of all the under fiends. But if so be
line 18505-->    Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes
line 18506-->    Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am
line 18507-->    Longer to live most weary, and present
line 18508-->    My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
line 18509-->    Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
line 18510-->    Since I have ever followed thee with hate,  
line 18511-->    Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
line 18512-->    And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
line 18513-->    It be to do thee service.
line 18514-->  AUFIDIUS. O Marcius, Marcius!
line 18515-->    Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
line 18516-->    A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
line 18517-->    Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
line 18518-->    And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more
line 18519-->    Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
line 18520-->    Mine arms about that body, where against
line 18521-->    My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
line 18522-->    And scarr'd the moon with splinters; here I clip
line 18523-->    The anvil of my sword, and do contest
line 18524-->    As hotly and as nobly with thy love
line 18525-->    As ever in ambitious strength I did
line 18526-->    Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
line 18527-->    I lov'd the maid I married; never man
line 18528-->    Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
line 18529-->    Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart
line 18530-->    Than when I first my wedded mistress saw  
line 18531-->    Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell the
line 18532-->    We have a power on foot, and I had purpose
line 18533-->    Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
line 18534-->    Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out
line 18535-->    Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
line 18536-->    Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me-
line 18537-->    We have been down together in my sleep,
line 18538-->    Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat-
line 18539-->    And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
line 18540-->    Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
line 18541-->    Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
line 18542-->    From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war
line 18543-->    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
line 18544-->    Like a bold flood o'erbeat. O, come, go in,
line 18545-->    And take our friendly senators by th' hands,
line 18546-->    Who now are here, taking their leaves of me
line 18547-->    Who am prepar'd against your territories,
line 18548-->    Though not for Rome itself.
line 18549-->  CORIOLANUS. You bless me, gods!
line 18550-->  AUFIDIUS. Therefore, most. absolute sir, if thou wilt have  
line 18551-->    The leading of thine own revenges, take
line 18552-->    Th' one half of my commission, and set down-
line 18553-->    As best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st
line 18554-->    Thy country's strength and weakness- thine own ways,
line 18555-->    Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
line 18556-->    Or rudely visit them in parts remote
line 18557-->    To fright them ere destroy. But come in;
line 18558-->    Let me commend thee first to those that shall
line 18559-->    Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
line 18560-->    And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
line 18561-->    Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand; most welcome!
line 18562-->                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
line 18563-->
line 18564-->                    The two SERVINGMEN come forward
line 18565-->
line 18566-->  FIRST SERVANT. Here's a strange alteration!
line 18567-->  SECOND SERVANT. By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
line 18568-->    a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report
line 18569-->    of him.
line 18570-->  FIRST SERVANT. What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his  
line 18571-->    finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
line 18572-->  SECOND SERVANT. Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
line 18573-->    him; he had, sir, a kind of face, methought- I cannot tell how to
line 18574-->    term it.
line 18575-->  FIRST SERVANT. He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd,
line 18576-->    but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
line 18577-->  SECOND SERVANT. So did I, I'll be sworn. He is simply the rarest
line 18578-->    man i' th' world.
line 18579-->  FIRST SERVANT. I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot
line 18580-->    on.
line 18581-->  SECOND SERVANT. Who, my master?
line 18582-->  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, it's no matter for that.
line 18583-->  SECOND SERVANT. Worth six on him.
line 18584-->  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the
line 18585-->    greater soldier.
line 18586-->  SECOND SERVANT. Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that;
line 18587-->    for the defence of a town our general is excellent.
line 18588-->  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and for an assault too.
line 18589-->
line 18590-->                       Re-enter the third SERVINGMAN  
line 18591-->
line 18592-->  THIRD SERVANT. O slaves, I can tell you news- news, you rascals!
line 18593-->  BOTH. What, what, what? Let's partake.
line 18594-->  THIRD SERVANT. I would not be a Roman, of all nations;
line 18595-->    I had as lief be a condemn'd man.
line 18596-->  BOTH. Wherefore? wherefore?
line 18597-->  THIRD SERVANT. Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general-
line 18598-->    Caius Marcius.
line 18599-->  FIRST SERVANT. Why do you say 'thwack our general'?
line 18600-->  THIRD SERVANT. I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always
line 18601-->    good enough for him.
line 18602-->  SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too
line 18603-->    hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.
line 18604-->  FIRST SERVANT. He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
line 18605-->    on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a
line 18606-->    carbonado.
line 18607-->  SECOND SERVANT. An he had been cannibally given, he might have
line 18608-->    broil'd and eaten him too.
line 18609-->  FIRST SERVANT. But more of thy news!
line 18610-->  THIRD SERVANT. Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son  
line 18611-->    and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' th' table; no question
line 18612-->    asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him.
line 18613-->    Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself
line 18614-->    with's hand, and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse.
line 18615-->    But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i' th' middle
line 18616-->    and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half
line 18617-->    by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
line 18618-->    and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears; he will mow all
line 18619-->    down before him, and leave his passage poll'd.
line 18620-->  SECOND SERVANT. And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
line 18621-->  THIRD SERVANT. Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as
line 18622-->    many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst
line 18623-->    not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends,
line 18624-->    whilst he's in directitude.
line 18625-->  FIRST SERVANT. Directitude? What's that?
line 18626-->  THIRD SERVANT. But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and
line 18627-->    the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies
line 18628-->    after rain, and revel an with him.
line 18629-->  FIRST SERVANT. But when goes this forward?
line 18630-->  THIRD SERVANT. To-morrow, to-day, presently. You shall have the  
line 18631-->    drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis as it were parcel of their
line 18632-->    feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.
line 18633-->  SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
line 18634-->    This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and
line 18635-->    breed ballad-makers.
line 18636-->  FIRST SERVANT. Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
line 18637-->    day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent.
line 18638-->    Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mull'd, deaf, sleepy,
line 18639-->    insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a
line 18640-->    destroyer of men.
line 18641-->  SECOND SERVANT. 'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be
line 18642-->    a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
line 18643-->    cuckolds.
line 18644-->  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
line 18645-->  THIRD SERVANT. Reason: because they then less need one another. The
line 18646-->    wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.
line 18647-->    They are rising, they are rising.
line 18648-->  BOTH. In, in, in, in!                                   Exeunt
line 18649-->
line 18650-->
line 18651-->
line 18652-->
line 18653-->SCENE VI.
line 18654-->Rome. A public place
line 18655-->
line 18656-->Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS
line 18657-->
line 18658-->  SICINIUS. We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.
line 18659-->    His remedies are tame. The present peace
line 18660-->    And quietness of the people, which before
line 18661-->    Were in wild hurry, here do make his friends
line 18662-->    Blush that the world goes well; who rather had,
line 18663-->    Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
line 18664-->    Dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see
line 18665-->    Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going
line 18666-->    About their functions friendly.
line 18667-->
line 18668-->                          Enter MENENIUS
line 18669-->
line 18670-->  BRUTUS. We stood to't in good time. Is this Menenius?
line 18671-->  SICINIUS. 'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grown most kind
line 18672-->    Of late. Hail, sir!
line 18673-->  MENENIUS. Hail to you both!
line 18674-->  SICINIUS. Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd  
line 18675-->    But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,
line 18676-->    And so would do, were he more angry at it.
line 18677-->  MENENIUS. All's well, and might have been much better
line 18678-->    He could have temporiz'd.
line 18679-->  SICINIUS. Where is he, hear you?
line 18680-->  MENENIUS. Nay, I hear nothing; his mother and his wife
line 18681-->    Hear nothing from him.
line 18682-->
line 18683-->                     Enter three or four citizens
line 18684-->
line 18685-->  CITIZENS. The gods preserve you both!
line 18686-->  SICINIUS. God-den, our neighbours.
line 18687-->  BRUTUS. God-den to you all, god-den to you an.
line 18688-->  FIRST CITIZEN. Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees
line 18689-->    Are bound to pray for you both.
line 18690-->  SICINIUS. Live and thrive!
line 18691-->  BRUTUS. Farewell, kind neighbours; we wish'd Coriolanus
line 18692-->    Had lov'd you as we did.
line 18693-->  CITIZENS. Now the gods keep you!
line 18694-->  BOTH TRIBUNES. Farewell, farewell.             Exeunt citizens  
line 18695-->  SICINIUS. This is a happier and more comely time
line 18696-->    Than when these fellows ran about the streets
line 18697-->    Crying confusion.
line 18698-->  BRUTUS. Caius Marcius was
line 18699-->    A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
line 18700-->    O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
line 18701-->    Self-loving-
line 18702-->  SICINIUS. And affecting one sole throne,
line 18703-->    Without assistance.
line 18704-->  MENENIUS. I think not so.
line 18705-->  SICINIUS. We should by this, to all our lamentation,
line 18706-->    If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
line 18707-->  BRUTUS. The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
line 18708-->    Sits safe and still without him.
line 18709-->
line 18710-->                             Enter an AEDILE
line 18711-->
line 18712-->  AEDILE. Worthy tribunes,
line 18713-->    There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
line 18714-->    Reports the Volsces with several powers  
line 18715-->    Are ent'red in the Roman territories,
line 18716-->    And with the deepest malice of the war
line 18717-->    Destroy what lies before 'em.
line 18718-->  MENENIUS. 'Tis Aufidius,
line 18719-->    Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
line 18720-->    Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,
line 18721-->    Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
line 18722-->    And durst not once peep out.
line 18723-->  SICINIUS. Come, what talk you of Marcius?
line 18724-->  BRUTUS. Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
line 18725-->    The Volsces dare break with us.
line 18726-->  MENENIUS. Cannot be!
line 18727-->    We have record that very well it can;
line 18728-->    And three examples of the like hath been
line 18729-->    Within my age. But reason with the fellow
line 18730-->    Before you punish him, where he heard this,
line 18731-->    Lest you shall chance to whip your information
line 18732-->    And beat the messenger who bids beware
line 18733-->    Of what is to be dreaded.
line 18734-->  SICINIUS. Tell not me.  
line 18735-->    I know this cannot be.
line 18736-->  BRUTUS. Not Possible.
line 18737-->
line 18738-->                           Enter A MESSENGER
line 18739-->
line 18740-->  MESSENGER. The nobles in great earnestness are going
line 18741-->    All to the Senate House; some news is come
line 18742-->    That turns their countenances.
line 18743-->  SICINIUS. 'Tis this slave-
line 18744-->    Go whip him fore the people's eyes- his raising,
line 18745-->    Nothing but his report.
line 18746-->  MESSENGER. Yes, worthy sir,
line 18747-->    The slave's report is seconded, and more,
line 18748-->    More fearful, is deliver'd.
line 18749-->  SICINIUS. What more fearful?
line 18750-->  MESSENGER. It is spoke freely out of many mouths-
line 18751-->    How probable I do not know- that Marcius,
line 18752-->    Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
line 18753-->    And vows revenge as spacious as between
line 18754-->    The young'st and oldest thing.  
line 18755-->  SICINIUS. This is most likely!
line 18756-->  BRUTUS. Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish
line 18757-->    Good Marcius home again.
line 18758-->  SICINIUS. The very trick on 't.
line 18759-->  MENENIUS. This is unlikely.
line 18760-->    He and Aufidius can no more atone
line 18761-->    Than violent'st contrariety.
line 18762-->
line 18763-->                      Enter a second MESSENGER
line 18764-->
line 18765-->  SECOND MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Senate.
line 18766-->    A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
line 18767-->    Associated with Aufidius, rages
line 18768-->    Upon our territories, and have already
line 18769-->    O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire and took
line 18770-->    What lay before them.
line 18771-->
line 18772-->                            Enter COMINIUS
line 18773-->
line 18774-->  COMINIUS. O, you have made good work!  
line 18775-->  MENENIUS. What news? what news?
line 18776-->  COMINIUS. You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
line 18777-->    To melt the city leads upon your pates,
line 18778-->    To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses-
line 18779-->  MENENIUS. What's the news? What's the news?
line 18780-->  COMINIUS. Your temples burned in their cement, and
line 18781-->    Your franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd
line 18782-->    Into an auger's bore.
line 18783-->  MENENIUS. Pray now, your news?
line 18784-->    You have made fair work, I fear me. Pray, your news.
line 18785-->    If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' Volscians-
line 18786-->  COMINIUS. If!
line 18787-->    He is their god; he leads them like a thing
line 18788-->    Made by some other deity than Nature,
line 18789-->    That shapes man better; and they follow him
line 18790-->    Against us brats with no less confidence
line 18791-->    Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
line 18792-->    Or butchers killing flies.
line 18793-->  MENENIUS. You have made good work,
line 18794-->    You and your apron men; you that stood so much  
line 18795-->    Upon the voice of occupation and
line 18796-->    The breath of garlic-eaters!
line 18797-->  COMINIUS. He'll shake
line 18798-->    Your Rome about your ears.
line 18799-->  MENENIUS. As Hercules
line 18800-->    Did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work!
line 18801-->  BRUTUS. But is this true, sir?
line 18802-->  COMINIUS. Ay; and you'll look pale
line 18803-->    Before you find it other. All the regions
line 18804-->    Do smilingly revolt, and who resists
line 18805-->    Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
line 18806-->    And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
line 18807-->    Your enemies and his find something in him.
line 18808-->  MENENIUS. We are all undone unless
line 18809-->    The noble man have mercy.
line 18810-->  COMINIUS. Who shall ask it?
line 18811-->    The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
line 18812-->    Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
line 18813-->    Does of the shepherds; for his best friends, if they
line 18814-->    Should say 'Be good to Rome'- they charg'd him even  
line 18815-->    As those should do that had deserv'd his hate,
line 18816-->    And therein show'd fike enemies.
line 18817-->  MENENIUS. 'Tis true;
line 18818-->    If he were putting to my house the brand
line 18819-->    That should consume it, I have not the face
line 18820-->    To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
line 18821-->    You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!
line 18822-->  COMINIUS. You have brought
line 18823-->    A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
line 18824-->    S' incapable of help.
line 18825-->  BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not we brought it.
line 18826-->  MENENIUS. How! Was't we? We lov'd him, but, like beasts
line 18827-->    And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
line 18828-->    Who did hoot him out o' th' city.
line 18829-->  COMINIUS. But I fear
line 18830-->    They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
line 18831-->    The second name of men, obeys his points
line 18832-->    As if he were his officer. Desperation
line 18833-->    Is all the policy, strength, and defence,
line 18834-->    That Rome can make against them.  
line 18835-->
line 18836-->                       Enter a troop of citizens
line 18837-->
line 18838-->  MENENIUS. Here comes the clusters.
line 18839-->    And is Aufidius with him? You are they
line 18840-->    That made the air unwholesome when you cast
line 18841-->    Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
line 18842-->    Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming,
line 18843-->    And not a hair upon a soldier's head
line 18844-->    Which will not prove a whip; as many coxcombs
line 18845-->    As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
line 18846-->    And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
line 18847-->    If he could burn us all into one coal
line 18848-->    We have deserv'd it.
line 18849-->  PLEBEIANS. Faith, we hear fearful news.
line 18850-->  FIRST CITIZEN. For mine own part,
line 18851-->    When I said banish him, I said 'twas pity.
line 18852-->  SECOND CITIZEN. And so did I.
line 18853-->  THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
line 18854-->    many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we  
line 18855-->    willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our
line 18856-->    will.
line 18857-->  COMINIUS. Y'are goodly things, you voices!
line 18858-->  MENENIUS. You have made
line 18859-->    Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
line 18860-->  COMINIUS. O, ay, what else?
line 18861-->                                    Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
line 18862-->  SICINIUS. Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;
line 18863-->    These are a side that would be glad to have
line 18864-->    This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
line 18865-->    And show no sign of fear.
line 18866-->  FIRST CITIZEN. The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home. I
line 18867-->    ever said we were i' th' wrong when we banish'd him.
line 18868-->  SECOND CITIZEN. So did we all. But come, let's home.
line 18869-->                                                 Exeunt citizens
line 18870-->  BRUTUS. I do not like this news.
line 18871-->  SICINIUS. Nor I.
line 18872-->  BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
line 18873-->    Would buy this for a lie!
line 18874-->  SICINIUS. Pray let's go.                                Exeunt
line 18875-->
line 18876-->
line 18877-->
line 18878-->
line 18879-->SCENE VII.
line 18880-->A camp at a short distance from Rome
line 18881-->
line 18882-->Enter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT
line 18883-->
line 18884-->  AUFIDIUS. Do they still fly to th' Roman?
line 18885-->  LIEUTENANT. I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
line 18886-->    Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat,
line 18887-->    Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
line 18888-->    And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,
line 18889-->    Even by your own.
line 18890-->  AUFIDIUS. I cannot help it now,
line 18891-->    Unless by using means I lame the foot
line 18892-->    Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
line 18893-->    Even to my person, than I thought he would
line 18894-->    When first I did embrace him; yet his nature
line 18895-->    In that's no changeling, and I must excuse
line 18896-->    What cannot be amended.
line 18897-->  LIEUTENANT. Yet I wish, sir-
line 18898-->    I mean, for your particular- you had not
line 18899-->    Join'd in commission with him, but either
line 18900-->    Had borne the action of yourself, or else  
line 18901-->    To him had left it solely.
line 18902-->  AUFIDIUS. I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
line 18903-->    When he shall come to his account, he knows not
line 18904-->    What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
line 18905-->    And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
line 18906-->    To th' vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly
line 18907-->    And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
line 18908-->    Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
line 18909-->    As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
line 18910-->    That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
line 18911-->    Whene'er we come to our account.
line 18912-->  LIEUTENANT. Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
line 18913-->  AUFIDIUS. All places yield to him ere he sits down,
line 18914-->    And the nobility of Rome are his;
line 18915-->    The senators and patricians love him too.
line 18916-->    The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people
line 18917-->    Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
line 18918-->    To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
line 18919-->    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
line 18920-->    By sovereignty of nature. First he was  
line 18921-->    A noble servant to them, but he could not
line 18922-->    Carry his honours even. Whether 'twas pride,
line 18923-->    Which out of daily fortune ever taints
line 18924-->    The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
line 18925-->    To fail in the disposing of those chances
line 18926-->    Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
line 18927-->    Not to be other than one thing, not moving
line 18928-->    From th' casque to th' cushion, but commanding peace
line 18929-->    Even with the same austerity and garb
line 18930-->    As he controll'd the war; but one of these-
line 18931-->    As he hath spices of them all- not all,
line 18932-->    For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd,
line 18933-->    So hated, and so banish'd. But he has a merit
line 18934-->    To choke it in the utt'rance. So our virtues
line 18935-->    Lie in th' interpretation of the time;
line 18936-->    And power, unto itself most commendable,
line 18937-->    Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
line 18938-->    T' extol what it hath done.
line 18939-->    One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
line 18940-->    Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.  
line 18941-->    Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
line 18942-->    Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
line 18943-->                                                          Exeunt

line 18958-->
line 18959-->ACT V. SCENE I.
line 18960-->Rome. A public place
line 18961-->
line 18962-->Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS and BRUTUS, the two Tribunes, with others
line 18963-->
line 18964-->  MENENIUS. No, I'll not go. You hear what he hath said
line 18965-->    Which was sometime his general, who lov'd him
line 18966-->    In a most dear particular. He call'd me father;
line 18967-->    But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him:
line 18968-->    A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
line 18969-->    The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coy'd
line 18970-->    To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
line 18971-->  COMINIUS. He would not seem to know me.
line 18972-->  MENENIUS. Do you hear?
line 18973-->  COMINIUS. Yet one time he did call me by my name.
line 18974-->    I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops
line 18975-->    That we have bled together. 'Coriolanus'
line 18976-->    He would not answer to; forbid all names;
line 18977-->    He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
line 18978-->    Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire
line 18979-->    Of burning Rome.  
line 18980-->  MENENIUS. Why, so! You have made good work.
line 18981-->    A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
line 18982-->    To make coals cheap- a noble memory!
line 18983-->  COMINIUS. I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
line 18984-->    When it was less expected; he replied,
line 18985-->    It was a bare petition of a state
line 18986-->    To one whom they had punish'd.
line 18987-->  MENENIUS. Very well.
line 18988-->    Could he say less?
line 18989-->  COMINIUS. I offer'd to awaken his regard
line 18990-->    For's private friends; his answer to me was,
line 18991-->    He could not stay to pick them in a pile
line 18992-->    Of noisome musty chaff. He said 'twas folly,
line 18993-->    For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt
line 18994-->    And still to nose th' offence.
line 18995-->  MENENIUS. For one poor grain or two!
line 18996-->    I am one of those. His mother, wife, his child,
line 18997-->    And this brave fellow too- we are the grains:
line 18998-->    You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
line 18999-->    Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.  
line 19000-->  SICINIUS. Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid
line 19001-->    In this so never-needed help, yet do not
line 19002-->    Upbraid's with our distress. But sure, if you
line 19003-->    Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
line 19004-->    More than the instant army we can make,
line 19005-->    Might stop our countryman.
line 19006-->  MENENIUS. No; I'll not meddle.
line 19007-->  SICINIUS. Pray you go to him.
line 19008-->  MENENIUS. What should I do?
line 19009-->  BRUTUS. Only make trial what your love can do
line 19010-->    For Rome, towards Marcius.
line 19011-->  MENENIUS. Well, and say that Marcius
line 19012-->    Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
line 19013-->    Unheard- what then?
line 19014-->    But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
line 19015-->    With his unkindness? Say't be so?
line 19016-->  SICINIUS. Yet your good will
line 19017-->    Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
line 19018-->    As you intended well.
line 19019-->  MENENIUS. I'll undertake't;  
line 19020-->    I think he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip
line 19021-->    And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.
line 19022-->    He was not taken well: he had not din'd;
line 19023-->    The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
line 19024-->    We pout upon the morning, are unapt
line 19025-->    To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
line 19026-->    These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
line 19027-->    With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
line 19028-->    Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I'll watch him
line 19029-->    Till he be dieted to my request,
line 19030-->    And then I'll set upon him.
line 19031-->  BRUTUS. You know the very road into his kindness
line 19032-->    And cannot lose your way.
line 19033-->  MENENIUS. Good faith, I'll prove him,
line 19034-->    Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
line 19035-->    Of my success.                                          Exit
line 19036-->  COMINIUS. He'll never hear him.
line 19037-->  SICINIUS. Not?
line 19038-->  COMINIUS. I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye
line 19039-->    Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury  
line 19040-->    The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
line 19041-->    'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
line 19042-->    Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do,
line 19043-->    He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
line 19044-->    Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions;
line 19045-->    So that all hope is vain,
line 19046-->    Unless his noble mother and his wife,
line 19047-->    Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
line 19048-->    For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence,
line 19049-->    And with our fair entreaties haste them on.           Exeunt
line 19050-->
line 19051-->
line 19052-->
line 19053-->
line 19054-->SCENE II.
line 19055-->The Volscian camp before Rome
line 19056-->
line 19057-->Enter MENENIUS to the WATCH on guard
line 19058-->
line 19059-->  FIRST WATCH. Stay. Whence are you?
line 19060-->  SECOND WATCH. Stand, and go back.
line 19061-->  MENENIUS. You guard like men, 'tis well; but, by your leave,
line 19062-->    I am an officer of state and come
line 19063-->    To speak with Coriolanus.
line 19064-->  FIRST WATCH. From whence?
line 19065-->  MENENIUS. From Rome.
line 19066-->  FIRST WATCH. YOU may not pass; you must return. Our general
line 19067-->    Will no more hear from thence.
line 19068-->  SECOND WATCH. You'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before
line 19069-->    You'll speak with Coriolanus.
line 19070-->  MENENIUS. Good my friends,
line 19071-->    If you have heard your general talk of Rome
line 19072-->    And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks
line 19073-->    My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.
line 19074-->  FIRST WATCH. Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name
line 19075-->    Is not here passable.  
line 19076-->  MENENIUS. I tell thee, fellow,
line 19077-->    Thy general is my lover. I have been
line 19078-->    The book of his good acts whence men have read
line 19079-->    His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;
line 19080-->    For I have ever verified my friends-
line 19081-->    Of whom he's chief- with all the size that verity
line 19082-->    Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,
line 19083-->    Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
line 19084-->    I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise
line 19085-->    Have almost stamp'd the leasing; therefore, fellow,
line 19086-->    I must have leave to pass.
line 19087-->  FIRST WATCH. Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf
line 19088-->    as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here;
line 19089-->    no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely.
line 19090-->    Therefore go back.
line 19091-->  MENENIUS. Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always
line 19092-->    factionary on the party of your general.
line 19093-->  SECOND WATCH. Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
line 19094-->    have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot
line 19095-->    pass. Therefore go back.  
line 19096-->  MENENIUS. Has he din'd, canst thou tell? For I would not speak with
line 19097-->    him till after dinner.
line 19098-->  FIRST WATCH. You are a Roman, are you?
line 19099-->  MENENIUS. I am as thy general is.
line 19100-->  FIRST WATCH. Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when
line 19101-->    you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in
line 19102-->    a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think
line 19103-->    to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the
line 19104-->    virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied
line 19105-->    intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you
line 19106-->    think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame
line 19107-->    in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore
line 19108-->    back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemn'd;
line 19109-->    our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.
line 19110-->  MENENIUS. Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me
line 19111-->    with estimation.
line 19112-->  FIRST WATCH. Come, my captain knows you not.
line 19113-->  MENENIUS. I mean thy general.
line 19114-->  FIRST WATCH. My general cares not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I
line 19115-->    let forth your half pint of blood. Back- that's the utmost of  
line 19116-->    your having. Back.
line 19117-->  MENENIUS. Nay, but fellow, fellow-
line 19118-->
line 19119-->                      Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS
line 19120-->
line 19121-->  CORIOLANUS. What's the matter?
line 19122-->  MENENIUS. Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you; you shall
line 19123-->    know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack
line 19124-->    guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus. Guess but by my
line 19125-->    entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of
line 19126-->    hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller
line 19127-->    in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what's to come
line 19128-->    upon thee. The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
line 19129-->    particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father
line 19130-->    Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us;
line 19131-->    look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come
line 19132-->    to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I
line 19133-->    have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to
line 19134-->    pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage
line 19135-->    thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this,  
line 19136-->    who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.
line 19137-->  CORIOLANUS. Away!
line 19138-->  MENENIUS. How! away!
line 19139-->  CORIOLANUS. Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
line 19140-->    Are servanted to others. Though I owe
line 19141-->    My revenge properly, my remission lies
line 19142-->    In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
line 19143-->    Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
line 19144-->    Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone.
line 19145-->    Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
line 19146-->    Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee,
line 19147-->    Take this along; I writ it for thy sake     [Gives a letter]
line 19148-->    And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,
line 19149-->    I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
line 19150-->    Was my belov'd in Rome; yet thou behold'st.
line 19151-->  AUFIDIUS. You keep a constant temper.
line 19152-->                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and Aufidius
line 19153-->  FIRST WATCH. Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
line 19154-->  SECOND WATCH. 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power! You know the
line 19155-->    way home again.  
line 19156-->  FIRST WATCH. Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
line 19157-->    greatness back?
line 19158-->  SECOND WATCH. What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
line 19159-->  MENENIUS. I neither care for th' world nor your general; for such
line 19160-->    things as you, I can scarce think there's any, y'are so slight.
line 19161-->    He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another.
line 19162-->    Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long;
line 19163-->    and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was
line 19164-->    said to: Away!                                          Exit
line 19165-->  FIRST WATCH. A noble fellow, I warrant him.
line 19166-->  SECOND WATCH. The worthy fellow is our general; he's the rock, the
line 19167-->    oak not to be wind-shaken.                            Exeunt
line 19168-->
line 19169-->
line 19170-->
line 19171-->
line 19172-->SCENE III.
line 19173-->The tent of CORIOLANUS
line 19174-->
line 19175-->Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others
line 19176-->
line 19177-->  CORIOLANUS. We will before the walls of Rome to-morrow
line 19178-->    Set down our host. My partner in this action,
line 19179-->    You must report to th' Volscian lords how plainly
line 19180-->    I have borne this business.
line 19181-->  AUFIDIUS. Only their ends
line 19182-->    You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
line 19183-->    The general suit of Rome; never admitted
line 19184-->    A private whisper- no, not with such friends
line 19185-->    That thought them sure of you.
line 19186-->  CORIOLANUS. This last old man,
line 19187-->    Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
line 19188-->    Lov'd me above the measure of a father;
line 19189-->    Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
line 19190-->    Was to send him; for whose old love I have-
line 19191-->    Though I show'd sourly to him- once more offer'd
line 19192-->    The first conditions, which they did refuse
line 19193-->    And cannot now accept. To grace him only,  
line 19194-->    That thought he could do more, a very little
line 19195-->    I have yielded to; fresh embassies and suits,
line 19196-->    Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
line 19197-->    Will I lend ear to.  [Shout within]  Ha! what shout is this?
line 19198-->    Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
line 19199-->    In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
line 19200-->
line 19201-->       Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, VALERIA,
line 19202-->                   YOUNG MARCIUS, with attendants
line 19203-->
line 19204-->    My wife comes foremost, then the honour'd mould
line 19205-->    Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand
line 19206-->    The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!
line 19207-->    All bond and privilege of nature, break!
line 19208-->    Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
line 19209-->    What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes,
line 19210-->    Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
line 19211-->    Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,
line 19212-->    As if Olympus to a molehill should
line 19213-->    In supplication nod; and my young boy  
line 19214-->    Hath an aspect of intercession which
line 19215-->    Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
line 19216-->    Plough Rome and harrow Italy; I'll never
line 19217-->    Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand
line 19218-->    As if a man were author of himself
line 19219-->    And knew no other kin.
line 19220-->  VIRGILIA. My lord and husband!
line 19221-->  CORIOLANUS. These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
line 19222-->  VIRGILIA. The sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd
line 19223-->    Makes you think so.
line 19224-->  CORIOLANUS. Like a dull actor now
line 19225-->    I have forgot my part and I am out,
line 19226-->    Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
line 19227-->    Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,
line 19228-->    For that, 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
line 19229-->    Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
line 19230-->    Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
line 19231-->    I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
line 19232-->    Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
line 19233-->    And the most noble mother of the world  
line 19234-->    Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i' th' earth;       [Kneels]
line 19235-->    Of thy deep duty more impression show
line 19236-->    Than that of common sons.
line 19237-->  VOLUMNIA. O, stand up blest!
line 19238-->    Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
line 19239-->    I kneel before thee, and unproperly
line 19240-->    Show duty, as mistaken all this while
line 19241-->    Between the child and parent.                       [Kneels]
line 19242-->  CORIOLANUS. What's this?
line 19243-->    Your knees to me, to your corrected son?
line 19244-->    Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
line 19245-->    Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
line 19246-->    Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,
line 19247-->    Murd'ring impossibility, to make
line 19248-->    What cannot be slight work.
line 19249-->  VOLUMNIA. Thou art my warrior;
line 19250-->    I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
line 19251-->  CORIOLANUS. The noble sister of Publicola,
line 19252-->    The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
line 19253-->    That's curdied by the frost from purest snow,  
line 19254-->    And hangs on Dian's temple- dear Valeria!
line 19255-->  VOLUMNIA. This is a poor epitome of yours,
line 19256-->    Which by th' interpretation of full time
line 19257-->    May show like all yourself.
line 19258-->  CORIOLANUS. The god of soldiers,
line 19259-->    With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
line 19260-->    Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove
line 19261-->    To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' th' wars
line 19262-->    Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
line 19263-->    And saving those that eye thee!
line 19264-->  VOLUMNIA. Your knee, sirrah.
line 19265-->  CORIOLANUS. That's my brave boy.
line 19266-->  VOLUMNIA. Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
line 19267-->    Are suitors to you.
line 19268-->  CORIOLANUS. I beseech you, peace!
line 19269-->    Or, if you'd ask, remember this before:
line 19270-->    The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
line 19271-->    Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
line 19272-->    Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
line 19273-->    Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not  
line 19274-->    Wherein I seem unnatural; desire not
line 19275-->    T'allay my rages and revenges with
line 19276-->    Your colder reasons.
line 19277-->  VOLUMNIA. O, no more, no more!
line 19278-->    You have said you will not grant us any thing-
line 19279-->    For we have nothing else to ask but that
line 19280-->    Which you deny already; yet we will ask,
line 19281-->    That, if you fail in our request, the blame
line 19282-->    May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us.
line 19283-->  CORIOLANUS. Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
line 19284-->    Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
line 19285-->  VOLUMNIA. Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
line 19286-->    And state of bodies would bewray what life
line 19287-->    We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
line 19288-->    How more unfortunate than all living women
line 19289-->    Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should
line 19290-->    Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
line 19291-->    Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
line 19292-->    Making the mother, wife, and child, to see
line 19293-->    The son, the husband, and the father, tearing  
line 19294-->    His country's bowels out. And to poor we
line 19295-->    Thine enmity's most capital: thou bar'st us
line 19296-->    Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
line 19297-->    That all but we enjoy. For how can we,
line 19298-->    Alas, how can we for our country pray,
line 19299-->    Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
line 19300-->    Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose
line 19301-->    The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
line 19302-->    Our comfort in the country. We must find
line 19303-->    An evident calamity, though we had
line 19304-->    Our wish, which side should win; for either thou
line 19305-->    Must as a foreign recreant be led
line 19306-->    With manacles through our streets, or else
line 19307-->    Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
line 19308-->    And bear the palm for having bravely shed
line 19309-->    Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
line 19310-->    I purpose not to wait on fortune till
line 19311-->    These wars determine; if I can not persuade thee
line 19312-->    Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
line 19313-->    Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner  
line 19314-->    March to assault thy country than to tread-
line 19315-->    Trust to't, thou shalt not- on thy mother's womb
line 19316-->    That brought thee to this world.
line 19317-->  VIRGILIA. Ay, and mine,
line 19318-->    That brought you forth this boy to keep your name
line 19319-->    Living to time.
line 19320-->  BOY. 'A shall not tread on me!
line 19321-->    I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
line 19322-->  CORIOLANUS. Not of a woman's tenderness to be
line 19323-->    Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
line 19324-->    I have sat too long.                                [Rising]
line 19325-->  VOLUMNIA. Nay, go not from us thus.
line 19326-->    If it were so that our request did tend
line 19327-->    To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
line 19328-->    The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us
line 19329-->    As poisonous of your honour. No, our suit
line 19330-->    Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
line 19331-->    May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans
line 19332-->    'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
line 19333-->    Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest  
line 19334-->    For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
line 19335-->    The end of war's uncertain; but this certain,
line 19336-->    That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
line 19337-->    Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
line 19338-->    Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
line 19339-->    Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
line 19340-->    But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,
line 19341-->    Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
line 19342-->    To th' ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son.
line 19343-->    Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
line 19344-->    To imitate the graces of the gods,
line 19345-->    To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air,
line 19346-->    And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
line 19347-->    That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
line 19348-->    Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
line 19349-->    Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
line 19350-->    He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;
line 19351-->    Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
line 19352-->    Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
line 19353-->    More bound to's mother, yet here he lets me prate  
line 19354-->    Like one i' th' stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
line 19355-->    Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
line 19356-->    When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
line 19357-->    Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home
line 19358-->    Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
line 19359-->    And spurn me back; but if it he not so,
line 19360-->    Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,
line 19361-->    That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
line 19362-->    To a mother's part belongs. He turns away.
line 19363-->    Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
line 19364-->    To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
line 19365-->    Than pity to our prayers. Down. An end;
line 19366-->    This is the last. So we will home to Rome,
line 19367-->    And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!
line 19368-->    This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
line 19369-->    But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
line 19370-->    Does reason our petition with more strength
line 19371-->    Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go.
line 19372-->    This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
line 19373-->    His wife is in Corioli, and his child  
line 19374-->    Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch.
line 19375-->    I am hush'd until our city be afire,
line 19376-->    And then I'll speak a little.
line 19377-->                              [He holds her by the hand, silent]
line 19378-->  CORIOLANUS. O mother, mother!
line 19379-->    What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
line 19380-->    The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
line 19381-->    They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
line 19382-->    You have won a happy victory to Rome;
line 19383-->    But for your son- believe it, O, believe it!-
line 19384-->    Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
line 19385-->    If not most mortal to him. But let it come.
line 19386-->    Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
line 19387-->    I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
line 19388-->    Were you in my stead, would you have heard
line 19389-->    A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
line 19390-->  AUFIDIUS. I was mov'd withal.
line 19391-->  CORIOLANUS. I dare be sworn you were!
line 19392-->    And, sir, it is no little thing to make
line 19393-->    Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,  
line 19394-->    What peace you'fl make, advise me. For my part,
line 19395-->    I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you
line 19396-->    Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
line 19397-->  AUFIDIUS.  [Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy
line 19398-->      honour
line 19399-->    At difference in thee. Out of that I'll work
line 19400-->    Myself a former fortune.
line 19401-->  CORIOLANUS.  [To the ladies]  Ay, by and by;
line 19402-->    But we will drink together; and you shall bear
line 19403-->    A better witness back than words, which we,
line 19404-->    On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
line 19405-->    Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
line 19406-->    To have a temple built you. All the swords
line 19407-->    In Italy, and her confederate arms,
line 19408-->    Could not have made this peace.                       Exeunt
line 19409-->
line 19410-->
line 19411-->
line 19412-->
line 19413-->SCENE IV.
line 19414-->Rome. A public place
line 19415-->
line 19416-->Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS
line 19417-->
line 19418-->  MENENIUS. See you yond coign o' th' Capitol, yond cornerstone?
line 19419-->  SICINIUS. Why, what of that?
line 19420-->  MENENIUS. If it be possible for you to displace it with your little
line 19421-->    finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially his
line 19422-->    mother, may prevail with him. But I say there is no hope in't;
line 19423-->    our throats are sentenc'd, and stay upon execution.
line 19424-->  SICINIUS. Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
line 19425-->    condition of a man?
line 19426-->  MENENIUS. There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet
line 19427-->    your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown from man to
line 19428-->    dragon; he has wings, he's more than a creeping thing.
line 19429-->  SICINIUS. He lov'd his mother dearly.
line 19430-->  MENENIUS. So did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now
line 19431-->    than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe
line 19432-->    grapes; when he walks, he moves like an engine and the ground
line 19433-->    shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a corslet with
line 19434-->    his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in  
line 19435-->    his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is
line 19436-->    finish'd with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but
line 19437-->    eternity, and a heaven to throne in.
line 19438-->  SICINIUS. Yes- mercy, if you report him truly.
line 19439-->  MENENIUS. I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother
line 19440-->    shall bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is
line 19441-->    milk in a male tiger; that shall our poor city find. And all this
line 19442-->    is 'long of you.
line 19443-->  SICINIUS. The gods be good unto us!
line 19444-->  MENENIUS. No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us.
line 19445-->    When we banish'd him we respected not them; and, he returning to
line 19446-->    break our necks, they respect not us.
line 19447-->
line 19448-->                           Enter a MESSENGER
line 19449-->
line 19450-->  MESSENGER. Sir, if you'd save your life, fly to your house.
line 19451-->    The plebeians have got your fellow tribune
line 19452-->    And hale him up and down; all swearing if
line 19453-->    The Roman ladies bring not comfort home
line 19454-->    They'll give him death by inches.  
line 19455-->
line 19456-->                         Enter another MESSENGER
line 19457-->
line 19458-->  SICINIUS. What's the news?
line 19459-->  SECOND MESSENGER. Good news, good news! The ladies have prevail'd,
line 19460-->    The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone.
line 19461-->    A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
line 19462-->    No, not th' expulsion of the Tarquins.
line 19463-->  SICINIUS. Friend,
line 19464-->    Art thou certain this is true? Is't most certain?
line 19465-->  SECOND MESSENGER. As certain as I know the sun is fire.
line 19466-->    Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
line 19467-->    Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide
line 19468-->    As the recomforted through th' gates. Why, hark you!
line 19469-->                  [Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together]
line 19470-->    The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,
line 19471-->    Tabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans,
line 19472-->    Make the sun dance. Hark you!               [A shout within]
line 19473-->  MENENIUS. This is good news.
line 19474-->    I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia  
line 19475-->    Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
line 19476-->    A city full; of tribunes such as you,
line 19477-->    A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
line 19478-->    This morning for ten thousand of your throats
line 19479-->    I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
line 19480-->                                   [Sound still with the shouts]
line 19481-->  SICINIUS. First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
line 19482-->    Accept my thankfulness.
line 19483-->  SECOND MESSENGER. Sir, we have all
line 19484-->    Great cause to give great thanks.
line 19485-->  SICINIUS. They are near the city?
line 19486-->  MESSENGER. Almost at point to enter.
line 19487-->  SICINIUS. We'll meet them,
line 19488-->    And help the joy.                                     Exeunt
line 19489-->
line 19490-->
line 19491-->
line 19492-->
line 19493-->SCENE V.
line 19494-->Rome. A street near the gate
line 19495-->
line 19496-->Enter two SENATORS With VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, passing over the stage,
line 19497-->'With other LORDS
line 19498-->
line 19499-->  FIRST SENATOR. Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
line 19500-->    Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
line 19501-->    And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them.
line 19502-->    Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
line 19503-->    Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
line 19504-->  ALL. Welcome, ladies, welcome!
line 19505-->                    [A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt]

line 19509-->
line 19510-->SCENE VI.
line 19511-->Corioli. A public place
line 19512-->
line 19513-->Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with attendents
line 19514-->
line 19515-->  AUFIDIUS. Go tell the lords o' th' city I am here;
line 19516-->    Deliver them this paper' having read it,
line 19517-->    Bid them repair to th' market-place, where I,
line 19518-->    Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
line 19519-->    Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
line 19520-->    The city ports by this hath enter'd and
line 19521-->    Intends t' appear before the people, hoping
line 19522-->    To purge himself with words. Dispatch.
line 19523-->                                               Exeunt attendants
line 19524-->
line 19525-->           Enter three or four CONSPIRATORS of AUFIDIUS' faction
line 19526-->
line 19527-->    Most welcome!
line 19528-->  FIRST CONSPIRATOR. How is it with our general?
line 19529-->  AUFIDIUS. Even so
line 19530-->    As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
line 19531-->    And with his charity slain.  
line 19532-->  SECOND CONSPIRATOR. Most noble sir,
line 19533-->    If you do hold the same intent wherein
line 19534-->    You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
line 19535-->    Of your great danger.
line 19536-->  AUFIDIUS. Sir, I cannot tell;
line 19537-->    We must proceed as we do find the people.
line 19538-->  THIRD CONSPIRATOR. The people will remain uncertain whilst
line 19539-->    'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
line 19540-->    Makes the survivor heir of all.
line 19541-->  AUFIDIUS. I know it;
line 19542-->    And my pretext to strike at him admits
line 19543-->    A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
line 19544-->    Mine honour for his truth; who being so heighten'd,
line 19545-->    He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,
line 19546-->    Seducing so my friends; and to this end
line 19547-->    He bow'd his nature, never known before
line 19548-->    But to be rough, unswayable, and free.
line 19549-->  THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Sir, his stoutness
line 19550-->    When he did stand for consul, which he lost
line 19551-->    By lack of stooping-  
line 19552-->  AUFIDIUS. That I would have spoken of.
line 19553-->    Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth,
line 19554-->    Presented to my knife his throat. I took him;
line 19555-->    Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
line 19556-->    In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
line 19557-->    Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
line 19558-->    My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments
line 19559-->    In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
line 19560-->    Which he did end all his, and took some pride
line 19561-->    To do myself this wrong. Till, at the last,
line 19562-->    I seem'd his follower, not partner; and
line 19563-->    He wag'd me with his countenance as if
line 19564-->    I had been mercenary.
line 19565-->  FIRST CONSPIRATOR. So he did, my lord.
line 19566-->    The army marvell'd at it; and, in the last,
line 19567-->    When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
line 19568-->    For no less spoil than glory-
line 19569-->  AUFIDIUS. There was it;
line 19570-->    For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
line 19571-->    At a few drops of women's rheum, which are  
line 19572-->    As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
line 19573-->    Of our great action; therefore shall he die,
line 19574-->    And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
line 19575-->                                                      [Drums and
line 19576-->                trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people]
line 19577-->  FIRST CONSPIRATOR. Your native town you enter'd like a post,
line 19578-->    And had no welcomes home; but he returns
line 19579-->    Splitting the air with noise.
line 19580-->  SECOND CONSPIRATOR. And patient fools,
line 19581-->    Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
line 19582-->    With giving him glory.
line 19583-->  THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Therefore, at your vantage,
line 19584-->    Ere he express himself or move the people
line 19585-->    With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
line 19586-->    Which we will second. When he lies along,
line 19587-->    After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury
line 19588-->    His reasons with his body.
line 19589-->  AUFIDIUS. Say no more:
line 19590-->    Here come the lords.
line 19591-->  
line 19592-->                     Enter the LORDS of the city
line 19593-->
line 19594-->  LORDS. You are most welcome home.
line 19595-->  AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it.
line 19596-->    But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
line 19597-->    What I have written to you?
line 19598-->  LORDS. We have.
line 19599-->  FIRST LORD. And grieve to hear't.
line 19600-->    What faults he made before the last, I think
line 19601-->    Might have found easy fines; but there to end
line 19602-->    Where he was to begin, and give away
line 19603-->    The benefit of our levies, answering us
line 19604-->    With our own charge, making a treaty where
line 19605-->    There was a yielding- this admits no excuse.
line 19606-->  AUFIDIUS. He approaches; you shall hear him.
line 19607-->
line 19608-->            Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours;
line 19609-->                      the commoners being with him
line 19610-->
line 19611-->  CORIOLANUS. Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier;  
line 19612-->    No more infected with my country's love
line 19613-->    Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
line 19614-->    Under your great command. You are to know
line 19615-->    That prosperously I have attempted, and
line 19616-->    With bloody passage led your wars even to
line 19617-->    The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
line 19618-->    Doth more than counterpoise a full third part
line 19619-->    The charges of the action. We have made peace
line 19620-->    With no less honour to the Antiates
line 19621-->    Than shame to th' Romans; and we here deliver,
line 19622-->    Subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians,
line 19623-->    Together with the seal o' th' Senate, what
line 19624-->    We have compounded on.
line 19625-->  AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords;
line 19626-->    But tell the traitor in the highest degree
line 19627-->    He hath abus'd your powers.
line 19628-->  CORIOLANUS. Traitor! How now?
line 19629-->  AUFIDIUS. Ay, traitor, Marcius.
line 19630-->  CORIOLANUS. Marcius!
line 19631-->  AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think  
line 19632-->    I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
line 19633-->    Coriolanus, in Corioli?
line 19634-->    You lords and heads o' th' state, perfidiously
line 19635-->    He has betray'd your business and given up,
line 19636-->    For certain drops of salt, your city Rome-
line 19637-->    I say your city- to his wife and mother;
line 19638-->    Breaking his oath and resolution like
line 19639-->    A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
line 19640-->    Counsel o' th' war; but at his nurse's tears
line 19641-->    He whin'd and roar'd away your victory,
line 19642-->    That pages blush'd at him, and men of heart
line 19643-->    Look'd wond'ring each at others.
line 19644-->  CORIOLANUS. Hear'st thou, Mars?
line 19645-->  AUFIDIUS. Name not the god, thou boy of tears-
line 19646-->  CORIOLANUS. Ha!
line 19647-->  AUFIDIUS. -no more.
line 19648-->  CORIOLANUS. Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
line 19649-->    Too great for what contains it. 'Boy'! O slave!
line 19650-->    Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
line 19651-->    I was forc'd to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,  
line 19652-->    Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion-
line 19653-->    Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that
line 19654-->    Must bear my beating to his grave- shall join
line 19655-->    To thrust the lie unto him.
line 19656-->  FIRST LORD. Peace, both, and hear me speak.
line 19657-->  CORIOLANUS. Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
line 19658-->    Stain all your edges on me. 'Boy'! False hound!
line 19659-->    If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there
line 19660-->    That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
line 19661-->    Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli.
line 19662-->    Alone I did it. 'Boy'!
line 19663-->  AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords,
line 19664-->    Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
line 19665-->    Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
line 19666-->    Fore your own eyes and ears?
line 19667-->  CONSPIRATORS. Let him die for't.
line 19668-->  ALL THE PEOPLE. Tear him to pieces. Do it presently. He kill'd my
line 19669-->    son. My daughter. He kill'd my cousin Marcus. He kill'd my
line 19670-->    father.
line 19671-->  SECOND LORD. Peace, ho! No outrage- peace!  
line 19672-->    The man is noble, and his fame folds in
line 19673-->    This orb o' th' earth. His last offences to us
line 19674-->    Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
line 19675-->    And trouble not the peace.
line 19676-->  CORIOLANUS. O that I had him,
line 19677-->    With six Aufidiuses, or more- his tribe,
line 19678-->    To use my lawful sword!
line 19679-->  AUFIDIUS. Insolent villain!
line 19680-->  CONSPIRATORS. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
line 19681-->           [The CONSPIRATORS draw and kill CORIOLANUS,who falls.
line 19682-->                                         AUFIDIUS stands on him]
line 19683-->  LORDS. Hold, hold, hold, hold!
line 19684-->  AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me speak.
line 19685-->  FIRST LORD. O Tullus!
line 19686-->  SECOND LORD. Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
line 19687-->  THIRD LORD. Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
line 19688-->    Put up your swords.
line 19689-->  AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shall know- as in this rage,
line 19690-->    Provok'd by him, you cannot- the great danger
line 19691-->    Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice  
line 19692-->    That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
line 19693-->    To call me to your Senate, I'll deliver
line 19694-->    Myself your loyal servant, or endure
line 19695-->    Your heaviest censure.
line 19696-->  FIRST LORD. Bear from hence his body,
line 19697-->    And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded
line 19698-->    As the most noble corse that ever herald
line 19699-->    Did follow to his um.
line 19700-->  SECOND LORD. His own impatience
line 19701-->    Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
line 19702-->    Let's make the best of it.
line 19703-->  AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone,
line 19704-->    And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
line 19705-->    Help, three o' th' chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
line 19706-->    Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully;
line 19707-->    Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
line 19708-->    Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,
line 19709-->    Which to this hour bewail the injury,
line 19710-->    Yet he shall have a noble memory.
line 19711-->    Assist.               Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS  
line 19712-->                                          [A dead march sounded]

line 19783-->
line 19784-->
line 19785-->SCENE:
line 19786-->Britain; Italy
line 19787-->
line 19788-->
line 19789-->
line 19790-->ACT I. SCENE I.
line 19791-->Britain. The garden of CYMBELINE'S palace
line 19792-->
line 19793-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods
line 19794-->    No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
line 19795-->    Still seem as does the King's.
line 19796-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what's the matter?
line 19797-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
line 19798-->    He purpos'd to his wife's sole son- a widow
line 19799-->    That late he married- hath referr'd herself
line 19800-->    Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded;
line 19801-->    Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd. All
line 19802-->    Is outward sorrow, though I think the King
line 19803-->    Be touch'd at very heart.
line 19804-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. None but the King?
line 19805-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,
line 19806-->    That most desir'd the match. But not a courtier,
line 19807-->    Although they wear their faces to the bent
line 19808-->    Of the King's looks, hath a heart that is not
line 19809-->    Glad at the thing they scowl at.
line 19810-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. And why so?
line 19811-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing  
line 19812-->    Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her-
line 19813-->    I mean that married her, alack, good man!
line 19814-->    And therefore banish'd- is a creature such
line 19815-->    As, to seek through the regions of the earth
line 19816-->    For one his like, there would be something failing
line 19817-->    In him that should compare. I do not think
line 19818-->    So fair an outward and such stuff within
line 19819-->    Endows a man but he.
line 19820-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. You speak him far.
line 19821-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I do extend him, sir, within himself;
line 19822-->    Crush him together rather than unfold
line 19823-->    His measure duly.
line 19824-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What's his name and birth?
line 19825-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I cannot delve him to the root; his father
line 19826-->    Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
line 19827-->    Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
line 19828-->    But had his titles by Tenantius, whom
line 19829-->    He serv'd with glory and admir'd success,
line 19830-->    So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
line 19831-->    And had, besides this gentleman in question,  
line 19832-->    Two other sons, who, in the wars o' th' time,
line 19833-->    Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
line 19834-->    Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
line 19835-->    That he quit being; and his gentle lady,
line 19836-->    Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas'd
line 19837-->    As he was born. The King he takes the babe
line 19838-->    To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
line 19839-->    Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
line 19840-->    Puts to him all the learnings that his time
line 19841-->    Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
line 19842-->    As we do air, fast as 'twas minist'red,
line 19843-->    And in's spring became a harvest, liv'd in court-
line 19844-->    Which rare it is to do- most prais'd, most lov'd,
line 19845-->    A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
line 19846-->    A glass that feated them; and to the graver
line 19847-->    A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
line 19848-->    For whom he now is banish'd- her own price
line 19849-->    Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
line 19850-->    By her election may be truly read
line 19851-->    What kind of man he is.  
line 19852-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I honour him
line 19853-->    Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
line 19854-->    Is she sole child to th' King?
line 19855-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. His only child.
line 19856-->    He had two sons- if this be worth your hearing,
line 19857-->    Mark it- the eldest of them at three years old,
line 19858-->    I' th' swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
line 19859-->    Were stol'n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge
line 19860-->    Which way they went.
line 19861-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. How long is this ago?
line 19862-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Some twenty years.
line 19863-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That a king's children should be so convey'd,
line 19864-->    So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
line 19865-->    That could not trace them!
line 19866-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
line 19867-->    Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
line 19868-->    Yet is it true, sir.
line 19869-->  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do well believe you.
line 19870-->  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,
line 19871-->    The Queen, and Princess.                              Exeunt  
line 19872-->
line 19873-->              Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS, and IMOGEN
line 19874-->
line 19875-->  QUEEN. No, be assur'd you shall not find me, daughter,
line 19876-->    After the slander of most stepmothers,
line 19877-->    Evil-ey'd unto you. You're my prisoner, but
line 19878-->    Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
line 19879-->    That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
line 19880-->    So soon as I can win th' offended King,
line 19881-->    I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
line 19882-->    The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
line 19883-->    You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
line 19884-->    Your wisdom may inform you.
line 19885-->  POSTHUMUS. Please your Highness,
line 19886-->    I will from hence to-day.
line 19887-->  QUEEN. You know the peril.
line 19888-->    I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
line 19889-->    The pangs of barr'd affections, though the King
line 19890-->    Hath charg'd you should not speak together.             Exit
line 19891-->  IMOGEN. O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant  
line 19892-->    Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
line 19893-->    I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing-
line 19894-->    Always reserv'd my holy duty- what
line 19895-->    His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
line 19896-->    And I shall here abide the hourly shot
line 19897-->    Of angry eyes, not comforted to live
line 19898-->    But that there is this jewel in the world
line 19899-->    That I may see again.
line 19900-->  POSTHUMUS. My queen! my mistress!
line 19901-->    O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
line 19902-->    To be suspected of more tenderness
line 19903-->    Than doth become a man. I will remain
line 19904-->    The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth;
line 19905-->    My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
line 19906-->    Who to my father was a friend, to me
line 19907-->    Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
line 19908-->    And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
line 19909-->    Though ink be made of gall.
line 19910-->
line 19911-->                     Re-enter QUEEN  
line 19912-->
line 19913-->  QUEEN. Be brief, I pray you.
line 19914-->    If the King come, I shall incur I know not
line 19915-->    How much of his displeasure. [Aside] Yet I'll move him
line 19916-->    To walk this way. I never do him wrong
line 19917-->    But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
line 19918-->    Pays dear for my offences.                              Exit
line 19919-->  POSTHUMUS. Should we be taking leave
line 19920-->    As long a term as yet we have to live,
line 19921-->    The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
line 19922-->  IMOGEN. Nay, stay a little.
line 19923-->    Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
line 19924-->    Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:
line 19925-->    This diamond was my mother's; take it, heart;
line 19926-->    But keep it till you woo another wife,
line 19927-->    When Imogen is dead.
line 19928-->  POSTHUMUS. How, how? Another?
line 19929-->    You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
line 19930-->    And sear up my embracements from a next
line 19931-->    With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here  
line 19932-->                                              [Puts on the ring]
line 19933-->    While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
line 19934-->    As I my poor self did exchange for you,
line 19935-->    To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
line 19936-->    I still win of you. For my sake wear this;
line 19937-->    It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
line 19938-->    Upon this fairest prisoner.     [Puts a bracelet on her arm]
line 19939-->  IMOGEN. O the gods!
line 19940-->    When shall we see again?
line 19941-->
line 19942-->                  Enter CYMBELINE and LORDS
line 19943-->
line 19944-->  POSTHUMUS. Alack, the King!
line 19945-->  CYMBELINE. Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight
line 19946-->    If after this command thou fraught the court
line 19947-->    With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!
line 19948-->    Thou'rt poison to my blood.
line 19949-->  POSTHUMUS. The gods protect you,
line 19950-->    And bless the good remainders of the court!
line 19951-->    I am gone.                                              Exit  
line 19952-->  IMOGEN. There cannot be a pinch in death
line 19953-->    More sharp than this is.
line 19954-->  CYMBELINE. O disloyal thing,
line 19955-->    That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
line 19956-->    A year's age on me!
line 19957-->  IMOGEN. I beseech you, sir,
line 19958-->    Harm not yourself with your vexation.
line 19959-->    I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
line 19960-->    Subdues all pangs, all fears.
line 19961-->  CYMBELINE. Past grace? obedience?
line 19962-->  IMOGEN. Past hope, and in despair; that way past grace.
line 19963-->  CYMBELINE. That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
line 19964-->  IMOGEN. O blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle,
line 19965-->    And did avoid a puttock.
line 19966-->  CYMBELINE. Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
line 19967-->    A seat for baseness.
line 19968-->  IMOGEN. No; I rather added
line 19969-->    A lustre to it.
line 19970-->  CYMBELINE. O thou vile one!
line 19971-->  IMOGEN. Sir,  
line 19972-->    It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus.
line 19973-->    You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
line 19974-->    A man worth any woman; overbuys me
line 19975-->    Almost the sum he pays.
line 19976-->  CYMBELINE. What, art thou mad?
line 19977-->  IMOGEN. Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were
line 19978-->    A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
line 19979-->    Our neighbour shepherd's son!
line 19980-->
line 19981-->                          Re-enter QUEEN
line 19982-->
line 19983-->  CYMBELINE. Thou foolish thing!
line 19984-->    [To the QUEEN] They were again together. You have done
line 19985-->    Not after our command. Away with her,
line 19986-->    And pen her up.
line 19987-->  QUEEN. Beseech your patience.- Peace,
line 19988-->    Dear lady daughter, peace!- Sweet sovereign,
line 19989-->    Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort
line 19990-->    Out of your best advice.
line 19991-->  CYMBELINE. Nay, let her languish  
line 19992-->    A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
line 19993-->    Die of this folly.                          Exit, with LORDS
line 19994-->
line 19995-->                          Enter PISANIO
line 19996-->
line 19997-->  QUEEN. Fie! you must give way.
line 19998-->    Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
line 19999-->  PISANIO. My lord your son drew on my master.
line 20000-->  QUEEN. Ha!
line 20001-->    No harm, I trust, is done?
line 20002-->  PISANIO. There might have been,
line 20003-->    But that my master rather play'd than fought,
line 20004-->    And had no help of anger; they were parted
line 20005-->    By gentlemen at hand.
line 20006-->  QUEEN. I am very glad on't.
line 20007-->  IMOGEN. Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part
line 20008-->    To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
line 20009-->    I would they were in Afric both together;
line 20010-->    Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
line 20011-->    The goer-back. Why came you from your master?  
line 20012-->  PISANIO. On his command. He would not suffer me
line 20013-->    To bring him to the haven; left these notes
line 20014-->    Of what commands I should be subject to,
line 20015-->    When't pleas'd you to employ me.
line 20016-->  QUEEN. This hath been
line 20017-->    Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour
line 20018-->    He will remain so.
line 20019-->  PISANIO. I humbly thank your Highness.
line 20020-->  QUEEN. Pray walk awhile.
line 20021-->  IMOGEN. About some half-hour hence,
line 20022-->    Pray you speak with me. You shall at least
line 20023-->    Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.        Exeunt
line 20024-->
line 20025-->
line 20026-->
line 20027-->
line 20028-->SCENE II.
line 20029-->Britain. A public place
line 20030-->
line 20031-->Enter CLOTEN and two LORDS
line 20032-->
line 20033-->  FIRST LORD. Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence
line 20034-->    of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out,
line 20035-->    air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
line 20036-->  CLOTEN. If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
line 20037-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience.
line 20038-->  FIRST LORD. Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not
line 20039-->    hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
line 20040-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back
line 20041-->    side the town.
line 20042-->  CLOTEN. The villain would not stand me.
line 20043-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your
line 20044-->    face.
line 20045-->  FIRST LORD. Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he
line 20046-->    added to your having, gave you some ground.
line 20047-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.
line 20048-->    Puppies!
line 20049-->  CLOTEN. I would they had not come between us.  
line 20050-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long a
line 20051-->    fool you were upon the ground.
line 20052-->  CLOTEN. And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!
line 20053-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is
line 20054-->    damn'd.
line 20055-->  FIRST LORD. Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go
line 20056-->    not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection
line 20057-->    of her wit.
line 20058-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection
line 20059-->    should hurt her.
line 20060-->  CLOTEN. Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt
line 20061-->    done!
line 20062-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of
line 20063-->    an ass, which is no great hurt.
line 20064-->  CLOTEN. You'll go with us?
line 20065-->  FIRST LORD. I'll attend your lordship.
line 20066-->  CLOTEN. Nay, come, let's go together.
line 20067-->  SECOND LORD. Well, my lord.                             Exeunt

line 20072-->SCENE III.
line 20073-->Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace
line 20074-->
line 20075-->Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
line 20076-->
line 20077-->  IMOGEN. I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven,
line 20078-->    And questioned'st every sail; if he should write,
line 20079-->    And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
line 20080-->    As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
line 20081-->    That he spake to thee?
line 20082-->  PISANIO. It was: his queen, his queen!
line 20083-->  IMOGEN. Then wav'd his handkerchief?
line 20084-->  PISANIO. And kiss'd it, madam.
line 20085-->  IMOGEN. Senseless linen, happier therein than I!
line 20086-->    And that was all?
line 20087-->  PISANIO. No, madam; for so long
line 20088-->    As he could make me with his eye, or care
line 20089-->    Distinguish him from others, he did keep
line 20090-->    The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
line 20091-->    Still waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind
line 20092-->    Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
line 20093-->    How swift his ship.  
line 20094-->  IMOGEN. Thou shouldst have made him
line 20095-->    As little as a crow, or less, ere left
line 20096-->    To after-eye him.
line 20097-->  PISANIO. Madam, so I did.
line 20098-->  IMOGEN. I would have broke mine eyestrings, crack'd them but
line 20099-->    To look upon him, till the diminution
line 20100-->    Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;
line 20101-->    Nay, followed him till he had melted from
line 20102-->    The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
line 20103-->    Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
line 20104-->    When shall we hear from him?
line 20105-->  PISANIO. Be assur'd, madam,
line 20106-->    With his next vantage.
line 20107-->  IMOGEN. I did not take my leave of him, but had
line 20108-->    Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him
line 20109-->    How I would think on him at certain hours
line 20110-->    Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear
line 20111-->    The shes of Italy should not betray
line 20112-->    Mine interest and his honour; or have charg'd him,
line 20113-->    At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,  
line 20114-->    T' encounter me with orisons, for then
line 20115-->    I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
line 20116-->    Give him that parting kiss which I had set
line 20117-->    Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,
line 20118-->    And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
line 20119-->    Shakes all our buds from growing.
line 20120-->
line 20121-->                        Enter a LADY
line 20122-->
line 20123-->  LADY. The Queen, madam,
line 20124-->    Desires your Highness' company.
line 20125-->  IMOGEN. Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
line 20126-->    I will attend the Queen.
line 20127-->  PISANIO. Madam, I shall.                                Exeunt
line 20128-->
line 20129-->
line 20130-->
line 20131-->
line 20132-->SCENE IV.
line 20133-->Rome. PHILARIO'S house
line 20134-->
line 20135-->Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a FRENCHMAN, a DUTCHMAN, and a SPANIARD
line 20136-->
line 20137-->  IACHIMO. Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then
line 20138-->    of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
line 20139-->    been allowed the name of. But I could then have look'd on him
line 20140-->    without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his
line 20141-->    endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by
line 20142-->    items.
line 20143-->  PHILARIO. You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
line 20144-->    is with that which makes him both without and within.
line 20145-->  FRENCHMAN. I have seen him in France; we had very many there could
line 20146-->    behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
line 20147-->  IACHIMO. This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he
line 20148-->    must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I
line 20149-->    doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
line 20150-->  FRENCHMAN. And then his banishment.
line 20151-->  IACHIMO. Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
line 20152-->    divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it
line 20153-->    but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay  
line 20154-->    flat, for taking a beggar, without less quality. But how comes it
line 20155-->    he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?
line 20156-->  PHILARIO. His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have
line 20157-->    been often bound for no less than my life.
line 20158-->
line 20159-->                       Enter POSTHUMUS
line 20160-->
line 20161-->    Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as
line 20162-->    suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
line 20163-->    quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman,
line 20164-->    whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is
line 20165-->    I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his
line 20166-->    own hearing.
line 20167-->  FRENCHMAN. Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
line 20168-->  POSTHUMUS. Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
line 20169-->    which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
line 20170-->  FRENCHMAN. Sir, you o'errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did
line 20171-->    atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have
line 20172-->    been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore,
line 20173-->    upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.  
line 20174-->  POSTHUMUS. By your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller;
line 20175-->    rather shunn'd to go even with what I heard than in my every
line 20176-->    action to be guided by others' experiences; but upon my mended
line 20177-->    judgment- if I offend not to say it is mended- my quarrel was not
line 20178-->    altogether slight.
line 20179-->  FRENCHMAN. Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and
line 20180-->    by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the
line 20181-->    other or have fall'n both.
line 20182-->  IACHIMO. Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
line 20183-->  FRENCHMAN. Safely, I think. 'Twas a contention in public, which
line 20184-->    may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like
line 20185-->    an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in
line 20186-->    praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
line 20187-->    vouching- and upon warrant of bloody affirmation- his to be more
line 20188-->    fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less
line 20189-->    attemptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
line 20190-->  IACHIMO. That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion,
line 20191-->    by this, worn out.
line 20192-->  POSTHUMUS. She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.
line 20193-->  IACHIMO. You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy.  
line 20194-->  POSTHUMUS. Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I would abate
line 20195-->    her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.
line 20196-->  IACHIMO. As fair and as good- a kind of hand-in-hand comparison-
line 20197-->    had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain.
line 20198-->    If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours
line 20199-->    outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she
line 20200-->    excelled many; but I have not seen the most precious diamond that
line 20201-->    is, nor you the lady.
line 20202-->  POSTHUMUS. I prais'd her as I rated her. So do I my stone.
line 20203-->  IACHIMO. What do you esteem it at?
line 20204-->  POSTHUMUS. More than the world enjoys.
line 20205-->  IACHIMO. Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead, or she's
line 20206-->    outpriz'd by a trifle.
line 20207-->  POSTHUMUS. You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there
line 20208-->    were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the
line 20209-->    other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.
line 20210-->  IACHIMO. Which the gods have given you?
line 20211-->  POSTHUMUS. Which by their graces I will keep.
line 20212-->  IACHIMO. You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl
line 20213-->    light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol'n too. So  
line 20214-->    your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and
line 20215-->    the other casual; a cunning thief, or a that-way-accomplish'd
line 20216-->    courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
line 20217-->  POSTHUMUS. Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to
line 20218-->    convince the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of
line 20219-->    that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of
line 20220-->    thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
line 20221-->  PHILARIO. Let us leave here, gentlemen.
line 20222-->  POSTHUMUS. Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank
line 20223-->    him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
line 20224-->  IACHIMO. With five times so much conversation I should get ground
line 20225-->    of your fair mistress; make her go back even to the yielding, had
line 20226-->    I admittance and opportunity to friend.
line 20227-->  POSTHUMUS. No, no.
line 20228-->  IACHIMO. I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your
line 20229-->    ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it something. But I make
line 20230-->    my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and,
line 20231-->    to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
line 20232-->    lady in the world.
line 20233-->  POSTHUMUS. You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion,  
line 20234-->    and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt.
line 20235-->  IACHIMO. What's that?
line 20236-->  POSTHUMUS. A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve
line 20237-->    more- a punishment too.
line 20238-->  PHILARIO. Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let
line 20239-->    it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.
line 20240-->  IACHIMO. Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th'
line 20241-->    approbation of what I have spoke!
line 20242-->  POSTHUMUS. What lady would you choose to assail?
line 20243-->  IACHIMO. Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will
line 20244-->    lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the
line 20245-->    court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the
line 20246-->    opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence
line 20247-->    that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd.
line 20248-->  POSTHUMUS. I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I
line 20249-->    hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
line 20250-->  IACHIMO. You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy
line 20251-->    ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from
line 20252-->    tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.
line 20253-->  POSTHUMUS. This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver  
line 20254-->    purpose, I hope.
line 20255-->  IACHIMO. I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what's
line 20256-->    spoken, I swear.
line 20257-->  POSTHUMUS. Will you? I Shall but lend my diamond till your return.
line 20258-->    Let there be covenants drawn between's. My mistress exceeds in
line 20259-->    goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to
line 20260-->    this match: here's my ring.
line 20261-->  PHILARIO. I will have it no lay.
line 20262-->  IACHIMO. By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient
line 20263-->    testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your
line 20264-->    mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond
line 20265-->    too. If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have
line 20266-->    trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours-
line 20267-->    provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.
line 20268-->  POSTHUMUS. I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt
line 20269-->    us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon
line 20270-->    her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd, I am
line 20271-->    no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate; if she remain
line 20272-->    unseduc'd, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill
line 20273-->    opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall  
line 20274-->    answer me with your sword.
line 20275-->  IACHIMO. Your hand- a covenant! We will have these things set down
line 20276-->    by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the
line 20277-->    bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and
line 20278-->    have our two wagers recorded.
line 20279-->  POSTHUMUS. Agreed.                Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO
line 20280-->  FRENCHMAN. Will this hold, think you?
line 20281-->  PHILARIO. Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow 'em.
line 20282-->                                                          Exeunt

line 20286-->
line 20287-->SCENE V.
line 20288-->Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace
line 20289-->
line 20290-->Enter QUEEN, LADIES, and CORNELIUS
line 20291-->
line 20292-->  QUEEN. Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
line 20293-->    Make haste; who has the note of them?
line 20294-->  LADY. I, madam.
line 20295-->  QUEEN. Dispatch.                                 Exeunt LADIES
line 20296-->    Now, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs?
line 20297-->  CORNELIUS. Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.
line 20298-->                                              [Presenting a box]
line 20299-->    But I beseech your Grace, without offence-
line 20300-->    My conscience bids me ask- wherefore you have
line 20301-->    Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds
line 20302-->    Which are the movers of a languishing death,
line 20303-->    But, though slow, deadly?
line 20304-->  QUEEN. I wonder, Doctor,
line 20305-->    Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
line 20306-->    Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
line 20307-->    To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
line 20308-->    That our great king himself doth woo me oft  
line 20309-->    For my confections? Having thus far proceeded-
line 20310-->    Unless thou think'st me devilish- is't not meet
line 20311-->    That I did amplify my judgment in
line 20312-->    Other conclusions? I will try the forces
line 20313-->    Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
line 20314-->    We count not worth the hanging- but none human-
line 20315-->    To try the vigour of them, and apply
line 20316-->    Allayments to their act, and by them gather
line 20317-->    Their several virtues and effects.
line 20318-->  CORNELIUS. Your Highness
line 20319-->    Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;
line 20320-->    Besides, the seeing these effects will be
line 20321-->    Both noisome and infectious.
line 20322-->  QUEEN. O, content thee.
line 20323-->
line 20324-->                        Enter PISANIO
line 20325-->
line 20326-->    [Aside] Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
line 20327-->    Will I first work. He's for his master,
line 20328-->    An enemy to my son.- How now, Pisanio!  
line 20329-->    Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
line 20330-->    Take your own way.
line 20331-->  CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do suspect you, madam;
line 20332-->    But you shall do no harm.
line 20333-->  QUEEN. [To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.
line 20334-->  CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has
line 20335-->    Strange ling'ring poisons. I do know her spirit,
line 20336-->    And will not trust one of her malice with
line 20337-->    A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
line 20338-->    Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,
line 20339-->    Which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs,
line 20340-->    Then afterward up higher; but there is
line 20341-->    No danger in what show of death it makes,
line 20342-->    More than the locking up the spirits a time,
line 20343-->    To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
line 20344-->    With a most false effect; and I the truer
line 20345-->    So to be false with her.
line 20346-->  QUEEN. No further service, Doctor,
line 20347-->    Until I send for thee.
line 20348-->  CORNELIUS. I humbly take my leave.                        Exit  
line 20349-->  QUEEN. Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
line 20350-->    She will not quench, and let instructions enter
line 20351-->    Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
line 20352-->    When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
line 20353-->    I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
line 20354-->    As great as is thy master; greater, for
line 20355-->    His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
line 20356-->    Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
line 20357-->    Continue where he is. To shift his being
line 20358-->    Is to exchange one misery with another,
line 20359-->    And every day that comes comes comes to
line 20360-->    A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
line 20361-->    To be depender on a thing that leans,
line 20362-->    Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
line 20363-->    So much as but to prop him?
line 20364-->                  [The QUEEN drops the box. PISANIO takes it up]
line 20365-->    Thou tak'st up
line 20366-->    Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour.
line 20367-->    It is a thing I made, which hath the King
line 20368-->    Five times redeem'd from death. I do not know  
line 20369-->    What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;
line 20370-->    It is an earnest of a further good
line 20371-->    That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
line 20372-->    The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
line 20373-->    Think what a chance thou changest on; but think
line 20374-->    Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,
line 20375-->    Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the King
line 20376-->    To any shape of thy preferment, such
line 20377-->    As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
line 20378-->    That set thee on to this desert, am bound
line 20379-->    To load thy merit richly. Call my women.
line 20380-->    Think on my words.                              Exit PISANIO
line 20381-->    A sly and constant knave,
line 20382-->    Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,
line 20383-->    And the remembrancer of her to hold
line 20384-->    The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
line 20385-->    Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
line 20386-->    Of leigers for her sweet; and which she after,
line 20387-->    Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd
line 20388-->    To taste of too.  
line 20389-->
line 20390-->                   Re-enter PISANIO and LADIES
line 20391-->
line 20392-->    So, so. Well done, well done.
line 20393-->    The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
line 20394-->    Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
line 20395-->    Think on my words.                   Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES
line 20396-->  PISANIO. And shall do.
line 20397-->    But when to my good lord I prove untrue
line 20398-->    I'll choke myself- there's all I'll do for you.         Exit
line 20399-->
line 20400-->
line 20401-->
line 20402-->
line 20403-->SCENE VI.
line 20404-->Britain. The palace
line 20405-->
line 20406-->Enter IMOGEN alone
line 20407-->
line 20408-->  IMOGEN. A father cruel and a step-dame false;
line 20409-->    A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
line 20410-->    That hath her husband banish'd. O, that husband!
line 20411-->    My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
line 20412-->    Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
line 20413-->    As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
line 20414-->    Is the desire that's glorious. Blessed be those,
line 20415-->    How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
line 20416-->    Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
line 20417-->
line 20418-->                    Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO
line 20419-->
line 20420-->  PISANIO. Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome
line 20421-->    Comes from my lord with letters.
line 20422-->  IACHIMO. Change you, madam?
line 20423-->    The worthy Leonatus is in safety,
line 20424-->    And greets your Highness dearly.         [Presents a letter]  
line 20425-->  IMOGEN. Thanks, good sir.
line 20426-->    You're kindly welcome.
line 20427-->  IACHIMO. [Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!
line 20428-->    If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
line 20429-->    She is alone th' Arabian bird, and I
line 20430-->    Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
line 20431-->    Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
line 20432-->    Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
line 20433-->    Rather, directly fly.
line 20434-->  IMOGEN. [Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
line 20435-->    kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him
line 20436-->    accordingly, as you value your trust.       LEONATUS.'
line 20437-->
line 20438-->    So far I read aloud;
line 20439-->    But even the very middle of my heart
line 20440-->    Is warm'd by th' rest and takes it thankfully.
line 20441-->    You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
line 20442-->    Have words to bid you; and shall find it so
line 20443-->    In all that I can do.
line 20444-->  IACHIMO. Thanks, fairest lady.  
line 20445-->    What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
line 20446-->    To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
line 20447-->    Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
line 20448-->    The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
line 20449-->    Upon the number'd beach, and can we not
line 20450-->    Partition make with spectacles so precious
line 20451-->    'Twixt fair and foul?
line 20452-->  IMOGEN. What makes your admiration?
line 20453-->  IACHIMO. It cannot be i' th' eye, for apes and monkeys,
line 20454-->    'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
line 20455-->    Contemn with mows the other; nor i' th' judgment,
line 20456-->    For idiots in this case of favour would
line 20457-->    Be wisely definite; nor i' th' appetite;
line 20458-->    Sluttery, to such neat excellence oppos'd,
line 20459-->    Should make desire vomit emptiness,
line 20460-->    Not so allur'd to feed.
line 20461-->  IMOGEN. What is the matter, trow?
line 20462-->  IACHIMO. The cloyed will-
line 20463-->    That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
line 20464-->    Both fill'd and running- ravening first the lamb,  
line 20465-->    Longs after for the garbage.
line 20466-->  IMOGEN. What, dear sir,
line 20467-->    Thus raps you? Are you well?
line 20468-->  IACHIMO. Thanks, madam; well.- Beseech you, sir,
line 20469-->    Desire my man's abode where I did leave him.
line 20470-->    He's strange and peevish.
line 20471-->  PISANIO. I was going, sir,
line 20472-->    To give him welcome.                                    Exit
line 20473-->  IMOGEN. Continues well my lord? His health beseech you?
line 20474-->  IACHIMO. Well, madam.
line 20475-->  IMOGEN. Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is.
line 20476-->  IACHIMO. Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
line 20477-->    So merry and so gamesome. He is call'd
line 20478-->    The Britain reveller.
line 20479-->  IMOGEN. When he was here
line 20480-->    He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
line 20481-->    Not knowing why.
line 20482-->  IACHIMO. I never saw him sad.
line 20483-->    There is a Frenchman his companion, one
line 20484-->    An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves  
line 20485-->    A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
line 20486-->    The thick sighs from him; whiles the jolly Briton-
line 20487-->    Your lord, I mean- laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
line 20488-->    Can my sides hold, to think that man- who knows
line 20489-->    By history, report, or his own proof,
line 20490-->    What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
line 20491-->    But must be- will's free hours languish for
line 20492-->    Assured bondage?'
line 20493-->  IMOGEN. Will my lord say so?
line 20494-->  IACHIMO. Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.
line 20495-->    It is a recreation to be by
line 20496-->    And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know
line 20497-->    Some men are much to blame.
line 20498-->  IMOGEN. Not he, I hope.
line 20499-->  IACHIMO. Not he; but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
line 20500-->    Be us'd more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
line 20501-->    In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.
line 20502-->    Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
line 20503-->    To pity too.
line 20504-->  IMOGEN. What do you pity, sir?  
line 20505-->  IACHIMO. Two creatures heartily.
line 20506-->  IMOGEN. Am I one, sir?
line 20507-->    You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
line 20508-->    Deserves your pity?
line 20509-->  IACHIMO. Lamentable! What,
line 20510-->    To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
line 20511-->    I' th' dungeon by a snuff?
line 20512-->  IMOGEN. I pray you, sir,
line 20513-->    Deliver with more openness your answers
line 20514-->    To my demands. Why do you pity me?
line 20515-->  IACHIMO. That others do,
line 20516-->    I was about to say, enjoy your- But
line 20517-->    It is an office of the gods to venge it,
line 20518-->    Not mine to speak on't.
line 20519-->  IMOGEN. You do seem to know
line 20520-->    Something of me, or what concerns me; pray you-
line 20521-->    Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
line 20522-->    Than to be sure they do; for certainties
line 20523-->    Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
line 20524-->    The remedy then born- discover to me  
line 20525-->    What both you spur and stop.
line 20526-->  IACHIMO. Had I this cheek
line 20527-->    To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
line 20528-->    Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
line 20529-->    To th' oath of loyalty; this object, which
line 20530-->    Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
line 20531-->    Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
line 20532-->    Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
line 20533-->    That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
line 20534-->    Made hard with hourly falsehood- falsehood as
line 20535-->    With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
line 20536-->    Base and illustrious as the smoky light
line 20537-->    That's fed with stinking tallow- it were fit
line 20538-->    That all the plagues of hell should at one time
line 20539-->    Encounter such revolt.
line 20540-->  IMOGEN. My lord, I fear,
line 20541-->    Has forgot Britain.
line 20542-->  IACHIMO. And himself. Not I
line 20543-->    Inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce
line 20544-->    The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces  
line 20545-->    That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
line 20546-->    Charms this report out.
line 20547-->  IMOGEN. Let me hear no more.
line 20548-->  IACHIMO. O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart
line 20549-->    With pity that doth make me sick! A lady
line 20550-->    So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
line 20551-->    Would make the great'st king double, to be partner'd
line 20552-->    With tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition
line 20553-->    Which your own coffers yield! with diseas'd ventures
line 20554-->    That play with all infirmities for gold
line 20555-->    Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
line 20556-->    As well might poison poison! Be reveng'd;
line 20557-->    Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
line 20558-->    Recoil from your great stock.
line 20559-->  IMOGEN. Reveng'd?
line 20560-->    How should I be reveng'd? If this be true-
line 20561-->    As I have such a heart that both mine ears
line 20562-->    Must not in haste abuse- if it be true,
line 20563-->    How should I be reveng'd?
line 20564-->  IACHIMO. Should he make me  
line 20565-->    Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,
line 20566-->    Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
line 20567-->    In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
line 20568-->    I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
line 20569-->    More noble than that runagate to your bed,
line 20570-->    And will continue fast to your affection,
line 20571-->    Still close as sure.
line 20572-->  IMOGEN. What ho, Pisanio!
line 20573-->  IACHIMO. Let me my service tender on your lips.
line 20574-->  IMOGEN. Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
line 20575-->    So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
line 20576-->    Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
line 20577-->    For such an end thou seek'st, as base as strange.
line 20578-->    Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
line 20579-->    From thy report as thou from honour; and
line 20580-->    Solicits here a lady that disdains
line 20581-->    Thee and the devil alike.- What ho, Pisanio!-
line 20582-->    The King my father shall be made acquainted
line 20583-->    Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit
line 20584-->    A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
line 20585-->    As in a Romish stew, and to expound
line 20586-->    His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
line 20587-->    He little cares for, and a daughter who
line 20588-->    He not respects at all.- What ho, Pisanio!
line 20589-->  IACHIMO. O happy Leonatus! I may say
line 20590-->    The credit that thy lady hath of thee
line 20591-->    Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
line 20592-->    Her assur'd credit. Blessed live you long,
line 20593-->    A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
line 20594-->    Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
line 20595-->    For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
line 20596-->    I have spoke this to know if your affiance
line 20597-->    Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord
line 20598-->    That which he is new o'er; and he is one
line 20599-->    The truest manner'd, such a holy witch
line 20600-->    That he enchants societies into him,
line 20601-->    Half all men's hearts are his.
line 20602-->  IMOGEN. You make amends.
line 20603-->  IACHIMO. He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
line 20604-->    He hath a kind of honour sets him of  
line 20605-->    More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
line 20606-->    Most mighty Princess, that I have adventur'd
line 20607-->    To try your taking of a false report, which hath
line 20608-->    Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
line 20609-->    In the election of a sir so rare,
line 20610-->    Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
line 20611-->    Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,
line 20612-->    Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.
line 20613-->  IMOGEN. All's well, sir; take my pow'r i' th' court for yours.
line 20614-->  IACHIMO. My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
line 20615-->    T' entreat your Grace but in a small request,
line 20616-->    And yet of moment too, for it concerns
line 20617-->    Your lord; myself and other noble friends
line 20618-->    Are partners in the business.
line 20619-->  IMOGEN. Pray what is't?
line 20620-->  IACHIMO. Some dozen Romans of us, and your lord-
line 20621-->    The best feather of our wing- have mingled sums
line 20622-->    To buy a present for the Emperor;
line 20623-->    Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
line 20624-->    In France. 'Tis plate of rare device, and jewels  
line 20625-->    Of rich and exquisite form, their values great;
line 20626-->    And I am something curious, being strange,
line 20627-->    To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
line 20628-->    To take them in protection?
line 20629-->  IMOGEN. Willingly;
line 20630-->    And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since
line 20631-->    My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
line 20632-->    In my bedchamber.
line 20633-->  IACHIMO. They are in a trunk,
line 20634-->    Attended by my men. I will make bold
line 20635-->    To send them to you only for this night;
line 20636-->    I must aboard to-morrow.
line 20637-->  IMOGEN. O, no, no.
line 20638-->  IACHIMO. Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
line 20639-->    By length'ning my return. From Gallia
line 20640-->    I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
line 20641-->    To see your Grace.
line 20642-->  IMOGEN. I thank you for your pains.
line 20643-->    But not away to-morrow!
line 20644-->  IACHIMO. O, I must, madam.  
line 20645-->    Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
line 20646-->    To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night.
line 20647-->    I have outstood my time, which is material
line 20648-->    'To th' tender of our present.
line 20649-->  IMOGEN. I will write.
line 20650-->    Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept
line 20651-->    And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.           Exeunt

line 20667-->ACT II. SCENE I.
line 20668-->Britain. Before CYMBELINE'S palace
line 20669-->
line 20670-->Enter CLOTEN and the two LORDS
line 20671-->
line 20672-->  CLOTEN. Was there ever man had such luck! When I kiss'd the jack,
line 20673-->    upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on't; and
line 20674-->    then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I
line 20675-->    borrowed mine oaths of him, and might not spend them at my
line 20676-->    pleasure.
line 20677-->  FIRST LORD. What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your
line 20678-->    bowl.
line 20679-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it
line 20680-->    would have run all out.
line 20681-->  CLOTEN. When a gentleman is dispos'd to swear, it is not for any
line 20682-->    standers-by to curtail his oaths. Ha?
line 20683-->  SECOND LORD. No, my lord; [Aside] nor crop the ears of them.
line 20684-->  CLOTEN. Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had been
line 20685-->    one of my rank!
line 20686-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] To have smell'd like a fool.
line 20687-->  CLOTEN. I am not vex'd more at anything in th' earth. A pox on't! I
line 20688-->    had rather not be so noble as I am; they dare not fight with me,  
line 20689-->    because of the Queen my mother. Every jackslave hath his bellyful
line 20690-->    of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody
line 20691-->    can match.
line 20692-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
line 20693-->    cock, with your comb on.
line 20694-->  CLOTEN. Sayest thou?
line 20695-->  SECOND LORD. It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
line 20696-->    companion that you give offence to.
line 20697-->  CLOTEN. No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to
line 20698-->    my inferiors.
line 20699-->  SECOND LORD. Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
line 20700-->  CLOTEN. Why, so I say.
line 20701-->  FIRST LORD. Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court
line 20702-->    to-night?
line 20703-->  CLOTEN. A stranger, and I not known on't?
line 20704-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
line 20705-->    not.
line 20706-->  FIRST LORD. There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of
line 20707-->    Leonatus' friends.
line 20708-->  CLOTEN. Leonatus? A banish'd rascal; and he's another, whatsoever  
line 20709-->    he be. Who told you of this stranger?
line 20710-->  FIRST LORD. One of your lordship's pages.
line 20711-->  CLOTEN. Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation
line 20712-->    in't?
line 20713-->  SECOND LORD. You cannot derogate, my lord.
line 20714-->  CLOTEN. Not easily, I think.
line 20715-->  SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues,
line 20716-->    being foolish, do not derogate.
line 20717-->  CLOTEN. Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost to-day at
line 20718-->    bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
line 20719-->  SECOND LORD. I'll attend your lordship.
line 20720-->                                    Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD
line 20721-->    That such a crafty devil as is his mother
line 20722-->    Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
line 20723-->    Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
line 20724-->    Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
line 20725-->    And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
line 20726-->    Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,
line 20727-->    Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
line 20728-->    A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
line 20729-->    More hateful than the foul expulsion is
line 20730-->    Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
line 20731-->    Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm
line 20732-->    The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd
line 20733-->    That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
line 20734-->    T' enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!         Exit
line 20735-->
line 20736-->
line 20737-->
line 20738-->
line 20739-->SCENE II.
line 20740-->Britain. IMOGEN'S bedchamber in CYMBELINE'S palace; a trunk in one corner
line 20741-->
line 20742-->Enter IMOGEN in her bed, and a LADY attending
line 20743-->
line 20744-->  IMOGEN. Who's there? My woman? Helen?
line 20745-->  LADY. Please you, madam.
line 20746-->  IMOGEN. What hour is it?
line 20747-->  LADY. Almost midnight, madam.
line 20748-->  IMOGEN. I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak;
line 20749-->    Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.
line 20750-->    Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
line 20751-->    And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock,
line 20752-->    I prithee call me. Sleep hath seiz'd me wholly.    Exit LADY
line 20753-->    To your protection I commend me, gods.
line 20754-->    From fairies and the tempters of the night
line 20755-->    Guard me, beseech ye!
line 20756-->                          [Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk]
line 20757-->  IACHIMO. The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense
line 20758-->    Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
line 20759-->    Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd  
line 20760-->    The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
line 20761-->    How bravely thou becom'st thy bed! fresh lily,
line 20762-->    And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
line 20763-->    But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
line 20764-->    How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
line 20765-->    Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o' th' taper
line 20766-->    Bows toward her and would under-peep her lids
line 20767-->    To see th' enclosed lights, now canopied
line 20768-->    Under these windows white and azure, lac'd
line 20769-->    With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design
line 20770-->    To note the chamber. I will write all down:
line 20771-->    Such and such pictures; there the window; such
line 20772-->    Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figures-
line 20773-->    Why, such and such; and the contents o' th' story.
line 20774-->    Ah, but some natural notes about her body
line 20775-->    Above ten thousand meaner movables
line 20776-->    Would testify, t' enrich mine inventory.
line 20777-->    O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
line 20778-->    And be her sense but as a monument,
line 20779-->    Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off;  
line 20780-->                                       [Taking off her bracelet]
line 20781-->    As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
line 20782-->    'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
line 20783-->    As strongly as the conscience does within,
line 20784-->    To th' madding of her lord. On her left breast
line 20785-->    A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
line 20786-->    I' th' bottom of a cowslip. Here's a voucher
line 20787-->    Stronger than ever law could make; this secret
line 20788-->    Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
line 20789-->    The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
line 20790-->    Why should I write this down that's riveted,
line 20791-->    Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
line 20792-->    The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
line 20793-->    Where Philomel gave up. I have enough.
line 20794-->    To th' trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
line 20795-->    Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
line 20796-->    May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
line 20797-->    Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.  [Clock strikes]
line 20798-->    One, two, three. Time, time!             Exit into the trunk
line 20799-->
line 20800-->
line 20801-->
line 20802-->
line 20803-->SCENE III.
line 20804-->CYMBELINE'S palace. An ante-chamber adjoining IMOGEN'S apartments
line 20805-->
line 20806-->Enter CLOTEN and LORDS
line 20807-->
line 20808-->  FIRST LORD. Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most
line 20809-->    coldest that ever turn'd up ace.
line 20810-->  CLOTEN. It would make any man cold to lose.
line 20811-->  FIRST LORD. But not every man patient after the noble temper of
line 20812-->    your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
line 20813-->  CLOTEN. Winning will put any man into courage. If I could get this
line 20814-->    foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough. It's almost morning,
line 20815-->    is't not?
line 20816-->  FIRST LORD. Day, my lord.
line 20817-->  CLOTEN. I would this music would come. I am advised to give her
line 20818-->    music a mornings; they say it will penetrate.
line 20819-->
line 20820-->                       Enter musicians
line 20821-->
line 20822-->    Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so.
line 20823-->    We'll try with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but  
line 20824-->    I'll never give o'er. First, a very excellent good-conceited
line 20825-->    thing; after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to
line 20826-->    it- and then let her consider.
line 20827-->
line 20828-->                 SONG
line 20829-->
line 20830-->      Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
line 20831-->        And Phoebus 'gins arise,
line 20832-->      His steeds to water at those springs
line 20833-->        On chalic'd flow'rs that lies;
line 20834-->      And winking Mary-buds begin
line 20835-->        To ope their golden eyes.
line 20836-->      With everything that pretty bin,
line 20837-->        My lady sweet, arise;
line 20838-->          Arise, arise!
line 20839-->
line 20840-->    So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music
line 20841-->    the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which
line 20842-->    horsehairs and calves' guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
line 20843-->    boot, can never amend.                      Exeunt musicians  
line 20844-->
line 20845-->                    Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
line 20846-->
line 20847-->  SECOND LORD. Here comes the King.
line 20848-->  CLOTEN. I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up
line 20849-->    so early. He cannot choose but take this service I have done
line 20850-->    fatherly.- Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother.
line 20851-->  CYMBELINE. Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
line 20852-->    Will she not forth?
line 20853-->  CLOTEN. I have assail'd her with musics, but she vouchsafes no
line 20854-->    notice.
line 20855-->  CYMBELINE. The exile of her minion is too new;
line 20856-->    She hath not yet forgot him; some more time
line 20857-->    Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
line 20858-->    And then she's yours.
line 20859-->  QUEEN. You are most bound to th' King,
line 20860-->    Who lets go by no vantages that may
line 20861-->    Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
line 20862-->    To orderly soliciting, and be friended
line 20863-->    With aptness of the season; make denials  
line 20864-->    Increase your services; so seem as if
line 20865-->    You were inspir'd to do those duties which
line 20866-->    You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
line 20867-->    Save when command to your dismission tends,
line 20868-->    And therein you are senseless.
line 20869-->  CLOTEN. Senseless? Not so.
line 20870-->
line 20871-->                    Enter a MESSENGER
line 20872-->
line 20873-->  MESSENGER. So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
line 20874-->    The one is Caius Lucius.
line 20875-->  CYMBELINE. A worthy fellow,
line 20876-->    Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
line 20877-->    But that's no fault of his. We must receive him
line 20878-->    According to the honour of his sender;
line 20879-->    And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
line 20880-->    We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
line 20881-->    When you have given good morning to your mistress,
line 20882-->    Attend the Queen and us; we shall have need
line 20883-->    T' employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.  
line 20884-->                                           Exeunt all but CLOTEN
line 20885-->  CLOTEN. If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,
line 20886-->    Let her lie still and dream. By your leave, ho!     [Knocks]
line 20887-->    I know her women are about her; what
line 20888-->    If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
line 20889-->    Which buys admittance; oft it doth-yea, and makes
line 20890-->    Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
line 20891-->    Their deer to th' stand o' th' stealer; and 'tis gold
line 20892-->    Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
line 20893-->    Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What
line 20894-->    Can it not do and undo? I will make
line 20895-->    One of her women lawyer to me, for
line 20896-->    I yet not understand the case myself.
line 20897-->    By your leave.                                      [Knocks]
line 20898-->
line 20899-->                            Enter a LADY
line 20900-->
line 20901-->  LADY. Who's there that knocks?
line 20902-->  CLOTEN. A gentleman.
line 20903-->  LADY. No more?  
line 20904-->  CLOTEN. Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
line 20905-->  LADY. That's more
line 20906-->    Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours
line 20907-->    Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
line 20908-->  CLOTEN. Your lady's person; is she ready?
line 20909-->  LADY. Ay,
line 20910-->    To keep her chamber.
line 20911-->  CLOTEN. There is gold for you; sell me your good report.
line 20912-->  LADY. How? My good name? or to report of you
line 20913-->    What I shall think is good? The Princess!
line 20914-->
line 20915-->                        Enter IMOGEN
line 20916-->
line 20917-->  CLOTEN. Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.
line 20918-->                                                       Exit LADY
line 20919-->  IMOGEN. Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
line 20920-->    For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give
line 20921-->    Is telling you that I am poor of thanks,
line 20922-->    And scarce can spare them.
line 20923-->  CLOTEN. Still I swear I love you.  
line 20924-->  IMOGEN. If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me.
line 20925-->    If you swear still, your recompense is still
line 20926-->    That I regard it not.
line 20927-->  CLOTEN. This is no answer.
line 20928-->  IMOGEN. But that you shall not say I yield, being silent,
line 20929-->    I would not speak. I pray you spare me. Faith,
line 20930-->    I shall unfold equal discourtesy
line 20931-->    To your best kindness; one of your great knowing
line 20932-->    Should learn, being taught, forbearance.
line 20933-->  CLOTEN. To leave you in your madness 'twere my sin;
line 20934-->    I will not.
line 20935-->  IMOGEN. Fools are not mad folks.
line 20936-->  CLOTEN. Do you call me fool?
line 20937-->  IMOGEN. As I am mad, I do;
line 20938-->    If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
line 20939-->    That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
line 20940-->    You put me to forget a lady's manners
line 20941-->    By being so verbal; and learn now, for all,
line 20942-->    That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
line 20943-->    By th' very truth of it, I care not for you,  
line 20944-->    And am so near the lack of charity
line 20945-->    To accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather
line 20946-->    You felt than make't my boast.
line 20947-->  CLOTEN. You sin against
line 20948-->    Obedience, which you owe your father. For
line 20949-->    The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
line 20950-->    One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
line 20951-->    With scraps o' th' court- it is no contract, none.
line 20952-->    And though it be allowed in meaner parties-
line 20953-->    Yet who than he more mean?- to knit their souls-
line 20954-->    On whom there is no more dependency
line 20955-->    But brats and beggary- in self-figur'd knot,
line 20956-->    Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
line 20957-->    The consequence o' th' crown, and must not foil
line 20958-->    The precious note of it with a base slave,
line 20959-->    A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
line 20960-->    A pantler- not so eminent!
line 20961-->  IMOGEN. Profane fellow!
line 20962-->    Wert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more
line 20963-->    But what thou art besides, thou wert too base  
line 20964-->    To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,
line 20965-->    Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
line 20966-->    Comparative for your virtues to be styl'd
line 20967-->    The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
line 20968-->    For being preferr'd so well.
line 20969-->  CLOTEN. The south fog rot him!
line 20970-->  IMOGEN. He never can meet more mischance than come
line 20971-->    To be but nam'd of thee. His mean'st garment
line 20972-->    That ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer
line 20973-->    In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
line 20974-->    Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
line 20975-->
line 20976-->                    Enter PISANIO
line 20977-->
line 20978-->  CLOTEN. 'His garments'! Now the devil-
line 20979-->  IMOGEN. To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.
line 20980-->  CLOTEN. 'His garment'!
line 20981-->  IMOGEN. I am sprited with a fool;
line 20982-->    Frighted, and ang'red worse. Go bid my woman
line 20983-->    Search for a jewel that too casually  
line 20984-->    Hath left mine arm. It was thy master's; shrew me,
line 20985-->    If I would lose it for a revenue
line 20986-->    Of any king's in Europe! I do think
line 20987-->    I saw't this morning; confident I am
line 20988-->    Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it.
line 20989-->    I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
line 20990-->    That I kiss aught but he.
line 20991-->  PISANIO. 'Twill not be lost.
line 20992-->  IMOGEN. I hope so. Go and search.                 Exit PISANIO
line 20993-->  CLOTEN. You have abus'd me.
line 20994-->    'His meanest garment'!
line 20995-->  IMOGEN. Ay, I said so, sir.
line 20996-->    If you will make 't an action, call witness to 't.
line 20997-->  CLOTEN. I will inform your father.
line 20998-->  IMOGEN. Your mother too.
line 20999-->    She's my good lady and will conceive, I hope,
line 21000-->    But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,
line 21001-->    To th' worst of discontent.                             Exit
line 21002-->  CLOTEN. I'll be reveng'd.
line 21003-->    'His mean'st garment'! Well.                            Exit
line 21004-->

line 21006-->
line 21007-->
line 21008-->SCENE IV.
line 21009-->Rome. PHILARIO'S house
line 21010-->
line 21011-->Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO
line 21012-->
line 21013-->  POSTHUMUS. Fear it not, sir; I would I were so sure
line 21014-->    To win the King as I am bold her honour
line 21015-->    Will remain hers.
line 21016-->  PHILARIO. What means do you make to him?
line 21017-->  POSTHUMUS. Not any; but abide the change of time,
line 21018-->    Quake in the present winter's state, and wish
line 21019-->    That warmer days would come. In these fear'd hopes
line 21020-->    I barely gratify your love; they failing,
line 21021-->    I must die much your debtor.
line 21022-->  PHILARIO. Your very goodness and your company
line 21023-->    O'erpays all I can do. By this your king
line 21024-->    Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius
line 21025-->    Will do's commission throughly; and I think
line 21026-->    He'll grant the tribute, send th' arrearages,
line 21027-->    Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
line 21028-->    Is yet fresh in their grief.
line 21029-->  POSTHUMUS. I do believe  
line 21030-->    Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
line 21031-->    That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
line 21032-->    The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
line 21033-->    In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
line 21034-->    Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
line 21035-->    Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
line 21036-->    Smil'd at their lack of skill, but found their courage
line 21037-->    Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline,
line 21038-->    Now mingled with their courages, will make known
line 21039-->    To their approvers they are people such
line 21040-->    That mend upon the world.
line 21041-->
line 21042-->                      Enter IACHIMO
line 21043-->
line 21044-->  PHILARIO. See! Iachimo!
line 21045-->  POSTHUMUS. The swiftest harts have posted you by land,
line 21046-->    And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
line 21047-->    To make your vessel nimble.
line 21048-->  PHILARIO. Welcome, sir.
line 21049-->  POSTHUMUS. I hope the briefness of your answer made  
line 21050-->    The speediness of your return.
line 21051-->  IACHIMO. Your lady
line 21052-->    Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
line 21053-->  POSTHUMUS. And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
line 21054-->    Look through a casement to allure false hearts,
line 21055-->    And be false with them.
line 21056-->  IACHIMO. Here are letters for you.
line 21057-->  POSTHUMUS. Their tenour good, I trust.
line 21058-->  IACHIMO. 'Tis very like.
line 21059-->  PHILARIO. Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
line 21060-->    When you were there?
line 21061-->  IACHIMO. He was expected then,
line 21062-->    But not approach'd.
line 21063-->  POSTHUMUS. All is well yet.
line 21064-->    Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is't not
line 21065-->    Too dull for your good wearing?
line 21066-->  IACHIMO. If I have lost it,
line 21067-->    I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
line 21068-->    I'll make a journey twice as far t' enjoy
line 21069-->    A second night of such sweet shortness which  
line 21070-->    Was mine in Britain; for the ring is won.
line 21071-->  POSTHUMUS. The stone's too hard to come by.
line 21072-->  IACHIMO. Not a whit,
line 21073-->    Your lady being so easy.
line 21074-->  POSTHUMUS. Make not, sir,
line 21075-->    Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we
line 21076-->    Must not continue friends.
line 21077-->  IACHIMO. Good sir, we must,
line 21078-->    If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
line 21079-->    The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
line 21080-->    We were to question farther; but I now
line 21081-->    Profess myself the winner of her honour,
line 21082-->    Together with your ring; and not the wronger
line 21083-->    Of her or you, having proceeded but
line 21084-->    By both your wills.
line 21085-->  POSTHUMUS. If you can make't apparent
line 21086-->    That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
line 21087-->    And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion
line 21088-->    You had of her pure honour gains or loses
line 21089-->    Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both  
line 21090-->    To who shall find them.
line 21091-->  IACHIMO. Sir, my circumstances,
line 21092-->    Being so near the truth as I will make them,
line 21093-->    Must first induce you to believe- whose strength
line 21094-->    I will confirm with oath; which I doubt not
line 21095-->    You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
line 21096-->    You need it not.
line 21097-->  POSTHUMUS. Proceed.
line 21098-->  IACHIMO. First, her bedchamber,
line 21099-->    Where I confess I slept not, but profess
line 21100-->    Had that was well worth watching-it was hang'd
line 21101-->    With tapestry of silk and silver; the story,
line 21102-->    Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
line 21103-->    And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
line 21104-->    The press of boats or pride. A piece of work
line 21105-->    So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
line 21106-->    In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
line 21107-->    Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
line 21108-->    Since the true life on't was-
line 21109-->  POSTHUMUS. This is true;  
line 21110-->    And this you might have heard of here, by me
line 21111-->    Or by some other.
line 21112-->  IACHIMO. More particulars
line 21113-->    Must justify my knowledge.
line 21114-->  POSTHUMUS. So they must,
line 21115-->    Or do your honour injury.
line 21116-->  IACHIMO. The chimney
line 21117-->    Is south the chamber, and the chimneypiece
line 21118-->    Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures
line 21119-->    So likely to report themselves. The cutter
line 21120-->    Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,
line 21121-->    Motion and breath left out.
line 21122-->  POSTHUMUS. This is a thing
line 21123-->    Which you might from relation likewise reap,
line 21124-->    Being, as it is, much spoke of.
line 21125-->  IACHIMO. The roof o' th' chamber
line 21126-->    With golden cherubins is fretted; her andirons-
line 21127-->    I had forgot them- were two winking Cupids
line 21128-->    Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
line 21129-->    Depending on their brands.  
line 21130-->  POSTHUMUS. This is her honour!
line 21131-->    Let it be granted you have seen all this, and praise
line 21132-->    Be given to your remembrance; the description
line 21133-->    Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
line 21134-->    The wager you have laid.
line 21135-->  IACHIMO. Then, if you can,                [Shows the bracelet]
line 21136-->    Be pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel. See!
line 21137-->    And now 'tis up again. It must be married
line 21138-->    To that your diamond; I'll keep them.
line 21139-->  POSTHUMUS. Jove!
line 21140-->    Once more let me behold it. Is it that
line 21141-->    Which I left with her?
line 21142-->  IACHIMO. Sir- I thank her- that.
line 21143-->    She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
line 21144-->    Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
line 21145-->    And yet enrich'd it too. She gave it me, and said
line 21146-->    She priz'd it once.
line 21147-->  POSTHUMUS. May be she pluck'd it of
line 21148-->    To send it me.
line 21149-->  IACHIMO. She writes so to you, doth she?  
line 21150-->  POSTHUMUS. O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;
line 21151-->                                                [Gives the ring]
line 21152-->    It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
line 21153-->    Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
line 21154-->    Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love
line 21155-->    Where there's another man. The vows of women
line 21156-->    Of no more bondage be to where they are made
line 21157-->    Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
line 21158-->    O, above measure false!
line 21159-->  PHILARIO. Have patience, sir,
line 21160-->    And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won.
line 21161-->    It may be probable she lost it, or
line 21162-->    Who knows if one her women, being corrupted
line 21163-->    Hath stol'n it from her?
line 21164-->  POSTHUMUS. Very true;
line 21165-->    And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring.
line 21166-->    Render to me some corporal sign about her,
line 21167-->    More evident than this; for this was stol'n.
line 21168-->  IACHIMO. By Jupiter, I had it from her arm!
line 21169-->  POSTHUMUS. Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.  
line 21170-->    'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure
line 21171-->    She would not lose it. Her attendants are
line 21172-->    All sworn and honourable- they induc'd to steal it!
line 21173-->    And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her.
line 21174-->    The cognizance of her incontinency
line 21175-->    Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
line 21176-->    There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
line 21177-->    Divide themselves between you!
line 21178-->  PHILARIO. Sir, be patient;
line 21179-->    This is not strong enough to be believ'd
line 21180-->    Of one persuaded well of.
line 21181-->  POSTHUMUS. Never talk on't;
line 21182-->    She hath been colted by him.
line 21183-->  IACHIMO. If you seek
line 21184-->    For further satisfying, under her breast-
line 21185-->    Worthy the pressing- lies a mole, right proud
line 21186-->    Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,
line 21187-->    I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger
line 21188-->    To feed again, though full. You do remember
line 21189-->    This stain upon her?  
line 21190-->  POSTHUMUS. Ay, and it doth confirm
line 21191-->    Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
line 21192-->    Were there no more but it.
line 21193-->  IACHIMO. Will you hear more?
line 21194-->  POSTHUMUS. Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns.
line 21195-->    Once, and a million!
line 21196-->  IACHIMO. I'll be sworn-
line 21197-->  POSTHUMUS. No swearing.
line 21198-->    If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
line 21199-->    And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
line 21200-->    Thou'st made me cuckold.
line 21201-->  IACHIMO. I'll deny nothing.
line 21202-->  POSTHUMUS. O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!
line 21203-->    I will go there and do't, i' th' court, before
line 21204-->    Her father. I'll do something-                          Exit
line 21205-->  PHILARIO. Quite besides
line 21206-->    The government of patience! You have won.
line 21207-->    Let's follow him and pervert the present wrath
line 21208-->    He hath against himself.
line 21209-->  IACHIMO. With all my heart.                             Exeunt
line 21210-->
line 21211-->
line 21212-->
line 21213-->
line 21214-->SCENE V.
line 21215-->Rome. Another room in PHILARIO'S house
line 21216-->
line 21217-->Enter POSTHUMUS
line 21218-->
line 21219-->  POSTHUMUS. Is there no way for men to be, but women
line 21220-->    Must be half-workers? We are all bastards,
line 21221-->    And that most venerable man which I
line 21222-->    Did call my father was I know not where
line 21223-->    When I was stamp'd. Some coiner with his tools
line 21224-->    Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem'd
line 21225-->    The Dian of that time. So doth my wife
line 21226-->    The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
line 21227-->    Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd,
line 21228-->    And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
line 21229-->    A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
line 21230-->    Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
line 21231-->    As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!
line 21232-->    This yellow Iachimo in an hour- was't not?
line 21233-->    Or less!- at first? Perchance he spoke not, but,
line 21234-->    Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
line 21235-->    Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition  
line 21236-->    But what he look'd for should oppose and she
line 21237-->    Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
line 21238-->    The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
line 21239-->    That tends to vice in man but I affirm
line 21240-->    It is the woman's part. Be it lying, note it,
line 21241-->    The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
line 21242-->    Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
line 21243-->    Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
line 21244-->    Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
line 21245-->    All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,
line 21246-->    Why, hers, in part or all; but rather all;
line 21247-->    For even to vice
line 21248-->    They are not constant, but are changing still
line 21249-->    One vice but of a minute old for one
line 21250-->    Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
line 21251-->    Detest them, curse them. Yet 'tis greater skill
line 21252-->    In a true hate to pray they have their will:
line 21253-->    The very devils cannot plague them better.              Exit

line 21268-->
line 21269-->ACT III. SCENE I.
line 21270-->Britain. A hall in CYMBELINE'S palace
line 21271-->
line 21272-->Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, and LORDS at one door,
line 21273-->and at another CAIUS LUCIUS and attendants
line 21274-->
line 21275-->  CYMBELINE. Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
line 21276-->  LUCIUS. When Julius Caesar- whose remembrance yet
line 21277-->    Lives in men's eyes, and will to ears and tongues
line 21278-->    Be theme and hearing ever- was in this Britain,
line 21279-->    And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,
line 21280-->    Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less
line 21281-->    Than in his feats deserving it, for him
line 21282-->    And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
line 21283-->    Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
line 21284-->    Is left untender'd.
line 21285-->  QUEEN. And, to kill the marvel,
line 21286-->    Shall be so ever.
line 21287-->  CLOTEN. There be many Caesars
line 21288-->    Ere such another Julius. Britain is
line 21289-->    A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
line 21290-->    For wearing our own noses.  
line 21291-->  QUEEN. That opportunity,
line 21292-->    Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
line 21293-->    We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
line 21294-->    The kings your ancestors, together with
line 21295-->    The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
line 21296-->    As Neptune's park, ribb'd and pal'd in
line 21297-->    With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
line 21298-->    With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats
line 21299-->    But suck them up to th' top-mast. A kind of conquest
line 21300-->    Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
line 21301-->    Of 'came, and saw, and overcame.' With shame-
line 21302-->    The first that ever touch'd him- he was carried
line 21303-->    From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping-
line 21304-->    Poor ignorant baubles!- on our terrible seas,
line 21305-->    Like egg-shells mov'd upon their surges, crack'd
line 21306-->    As easily 'gainst our rocks; for joy whereof
line 21307-->    The fam'd Cassibelan, who was once at point-
line 21308-->    O, giglot fortune!- to master Caesar's sword,
line 21309-->    Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright
line 21310-->    And Britons strut with courage.  
line 21311-->  CLOTEN. Come, there's no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is
line 21312-->    stronger than it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no
line 21313-->    moe such Caesars. Other of them may have crook'd noses; but to
line 21314-->    owe such straight arms, none.
line 21315-->  CYMBELINE. Son, let your mother end.
line 21316-->  CLOTEN. We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan.
line 21317-->    I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should
line 21318-->    we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket,
line 21319-->    or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light;
line 21320-->    else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
line 21321-->  CYMBELINE. You must know,
line 21322-->    Till the injurious Romans did extort
line 21323-->    This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar's ambition-
line 21324-->    Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
line 21325-->    The sides o' th' world- against all colour here
line 21326-->    Did put the yoke upon's; which to shake of
line 21327-->    Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
line 21328-->    Ourselves to be.
line 21329-->  CLOTEN. We do.
line 21330-->  CYMBELINE. Say then to Caesar,  
line 21331-->    Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
line 21332-->    Ordain'd our laws- whose use the sword of Caesar
line 21333-->    Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
line 21334-->    Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
line 21335-->    Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
line 21336-->    Who was the first of Britain which did put
line 21337-->    His brows within a golden crown, and call'd
line 21338-->    Himself a king.
line 21339-->  LUCIUS. I am sorry, Cymbeline,
line 21340-->    That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar-
line 21341-->    Caesar, that hath moe kings his servants than
line 21342-->    Thyself domestic officers- thine enemy.
line 21343-->    Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
line 21344-->    In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee; look
line 21345-->    For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
line 21346-->    I thank thee for myself.
line 21347-->  CYMBELINE. Thou art welcome, Caius.
line 21348-->    Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
line 21349-->    Much under him; of him I gather'd honour,
line 21350-->    Which he to seek of me again, perforce,  
line 21351-->    Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
line 21352-->    That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
line 21353-->    Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent
line 21354-->    Which not to read would show the Britons cold;
line 21355-->    So Caesar shall not find them.
line 21356-->  LUCIUS. Let proof speak.
line 21357-->  CLOTEN. His majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or
line 21358-->    two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
line 21359-->    shall find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it,
line 21360-->    it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare
line 21361-->    the better for you; and there's an end.
line 21362-->  LUCIUS. So, sir.
line 21363-->  CYMBELINE. I know your master's pleasure, and he mine;
line 21364-->    All the remain is, welcome.                           Exeunt
line 21365-->

line 21369-->SCENE II.
line 21370-->Britain. Another room in CYMBELINE'S palace
line 21371-->
line 21372-->Enter PISANIO reading of a letter
line 21373-->
line 21374-->  PISANIO. How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
line 21375-->    What monsters her accuse? Leonatus!
line 21376-->    O master, what a strange infection
line 21377-->    Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian-
line 21378-->    As poisonous-tongu'd as handed- hath prevail'd
line 21379-->    On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.
line 21380-->    She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
line 21381-->    More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
line 21382-->    As would take in some virtue. O my master!
line 21383-->    Thy mind to her is now as low as were
line 21384-->    Thy fortunes. How? that I should murder her?
line 21385-->    Upon the love, and truth, and vows, which I
line 21386-->    Have made to thy command? I, her? Her blood?
line 21387-->    If it be so to do good service, never
line 21388-->    Let me be counted serviceable. How look I
line 21389-->    That I should seem to lack humanity
line 21390-->    So much as this fact comes to? [Reads] 'Do't. The letter  
line 21391-->    That I have sent her, by her own command
line 21392-->    Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper,
line 21393-->    Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
line 21394-->    Art thou a fedary for this act, and look'st
line 21395-->    So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
line 21396-->
line 21397-->                      Enter IMOGEN
line 21398-->
line 21399-->    I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
line 21400-->  IMOGEN. How now, Pisanio!
line 21401-->  PISANIO. Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
line 21402-->  IMOGEN. Who? thy lord? That is my lord- Leonatus?
line 21403-->    O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
line 21404-->    That knew the stars as I his characters-
line 21405-->    He'd lay the future open. You good gods,
line 21406-->    Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
line 21407-->    Of my lord's health, of his content; yet not
line 21408-->    That we two are asunder- let that grieve him!
line 21409-->    Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
line 21410-->    For it doth physic love- of his content,  
line 21411-->    All but in that. Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
line 21412-->    You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
line 21413-->    And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
line 21414-->    Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
line 21415-->    You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
line 21416-->                                                         [Reads]
line 21417-->    'Justice and your father's wrath, should he take me in his
line 21418-->    dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of
line 21419-->    creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I
line 21420-->    am in Cambria, at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of
line 21421-->    this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness that
line 21422-->    remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love
line 21423-->                                            LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'
line 21424-->
line 21425-->    O for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
line 21426-->    He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me
line 21427-->    How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
line 21428-->    May plod it in a week, why may not I
line 21429-->    Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio-
line 21430-->    Who long'st like me to see thy lord, who long'st-  
line 21431-->    O, let me 'bate!- but not like me, yet long'st,
line 21432-->    But in a fainter kind- O, not like me,
line 21433-->    For mine's beyond beyond!-say, and speak thick-
line 21434-->    Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
line 21435-->    To th' smothering of the sense- how far it is
line 21436-->    To this same blessed Milford. And by th' way
line 21437-->    Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
line 21438-->    T' inherit such a haven. But first of all,
line 21439-->    How we may steal from hence; and for the gap
line 21440-->    That we shall make in time from our hence-going
line 21441-->    And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence.
line 21442-->    Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
line 21443-->    We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,
line 21444-->    How many score of miles may we well ride
line 21445-->    'Twixt hour and hour?
line 21446-->  PISANIO. One score 'twixt sun and sun,
line 21447-->    Madam, 's enough for you, and too much too.
line 21448-->  IMOGEN. Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
line 21449-->    Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers
line 21450-->    Where horses have been nimbler than the sands  
line 21451-->    That run i' th' clock's behalf. But this is fool'ry.
line 21452-->    Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
line 21453-->    She'll home to her father; and provide me presently
line 21454-->    A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
line 21455-->    A franklin's huswife.
line 21456-->  PISANIO. Madam, you're best consider.
line 21457-->  IMOGEN. I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,
line 21458-->    Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them
line 21459-->    That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
line 21460-->    Do as I bid thee. There's no more to say;
line 21461-->    Accessible is none but Milford way.                   Exeunt
line 21462-->

line 21464-->
line 21465-->
line 21466-->SCENE III.
line 21467-->Wales. A mountainous country with a cave
line 21468-->
line 21469-->Enter from the cave BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
line 21470-->
line 21471-->  BELARIUS. A goodly day not to keep house with such
line 21472-->    Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
line 21473-->    Instructs you how t' adore the heavens, and bows you
line 21474-->    To a morning's holy office. The gates of monarchs
line 21475-->    Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
line 21476-->    And keep their impious turbans on without
line 21477-->    Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
line 21478-->    We house i' th' rock, yet use thee not so hardly
line 21479-->    As prouder livers do.
line 21480-->  GUIDERIUS. Hail, heaven!
line 21481-->  ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven!
line 21482-->  BELARIUS. Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,
line 21483-->    Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
line 21484-->    When you above perceive me like a crow,
line 21485-->    That it is place which lessens and sets off;
line 21486-->    And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
line 21487-->    Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.  
line 21488-->    This service is not service so being done,
line 21489-->    But being so allow'd. To apprehend thus
line 21490-->    Draws us a profit from all things we see,
line 21491-->    And often to our comfort shall we find
line 21492-->    The sharded beetle in a safer hold
line 21493-->    Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
line 21494-->    Is nobler than attending for a check,
line 21495-->    Richer than doing nothing for a bribe,
line 21496-->    Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
line 21497-->    Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine,
line 21498-->    Yet keeps his book uncross'd. No life to ours!
line 21499-->  GUIDERIUS. Out of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg'd,
line 21500-->    Have never wing'd from view o' th' nest, nor know not
line 21501-->    What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
line 21502-->    If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
line 21503-->    That have a sharper known; well corresponding
line 21504-->    With your stiff age. But unto us it is
line 21505-->    A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
line 21506-->    A prison for a debtor that not dares
line 21507-->    To stride a limit.  
line 21508-->  ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of
line 21509-->    When we are old as you? When we shall hear
line 21510-->    The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
line 21511-->    In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse.
line 21512-->    The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
line 21513-->    We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,
line 21514-->    Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat.
line 21515-->    Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
line 21516-->    We make a choir, as doth the prison'd bird,
line 21517-->    And sing our bondage freely.
line 21518-->  BELARIUS. How you speak!
line 21519-->    Did you but know the city's usuries,
line 21520-->    And felt them knowingly- the art o' th' court,
line 21521-->    As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb
line 21522-->    Is certain falling, or so slipp'ry that
line 21523-->    The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' th' war,
line 21524-->    A pain that only seems to seek out danger
line 21525-->    I' th'name of fame and honour, which dies i' th'search,
line 21526-->    And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
line 21527-->    As record of fair act; nay, many times,  
line 21528-->    Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse-
line 21529-->    Must curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story
line 21530-->    The world may read in me; my body's mark'd
line 21531-->    With Roman swords, and my report was once
line 21532-->    first with the best of note. Cymbeline lov'd me;
line 21533-->    And when a soldier was the theme, my name
line 21534-->    Was not far off. Then was I as a tree
line 21535-->    Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night
line 21536-->    A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
line 21537-->    Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
line 21538-->    And left me bare to weather.
line 21539-->  GUIDERIUS. Uncertain favour!
line 21540-->  BELARIUS. My fault being nothing- as I have told you oft-
line 21541-->    But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
line 21542-->    Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
line 21543-->    I was confederate with the Romans. So
line 21544-->    Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
line 21545-->    This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
line 21546-->    Where I have liv'd at honest freedom, paid
line 21547-->    More pious debts to heaven than in all  
line 21548-->    The fore-end of my time. But up to th' mountains!
line 21549-->    This is not hunters' language. He that strikes
line 21550-->    The venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast;
line 21551-->    To him the other two shall minister;
line 21552-->    And we will fear no poison, which attends
line 21553-->    In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
line 21554-->                                  Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
line 21555-->    How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
line 21556-->    These boys know little they are sons to th' King,
line 21557-->    Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
line 21558-->    They think they are mine; and though train'd up thus meanly
line 21559-->    I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
line 21560-->    The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
line 21561-->    In simple and low things to prince it much
line 21562-->    Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
line 21563-->    The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
line 21564-->    The King his father call'd Guiderius- Jove!
line 21565-->    When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
line 21566-->    The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
line 21567-->    Into my story; say 'Thus mine enemy fell,  
line 21568-->    And thus I set my foot on's neck'; even then
line 21569-->    The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
line 21570-->    Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture
line 21571-->    That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
line 21572-->    Once Arviragus, in as like a figure
line 21573-->    Strikes life into my speech, and shows much more
line 21574-->    His own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous'd!
line 21575-->    O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows
line 21576-->    Thou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon,
line 21577-->    At three and two years old, I stole these babes,
line 21578-->    Thinking to bar thee of succession as
line 21579-->    Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,
line 21580-->    Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,
line 21581-->    And every day do honour to her grave.
line 21582-->    Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
line 21583-->    They take for natural father. The game is up.           Exit
line 21584-->
line 21585-->
line 21586-->
line 21587-->
line 21588-->SCENE IV.
line 21589-->Wales, near Milford Haven
line 21590-->
line 21591-->Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN
line 21592-->
line 21593-->  IMOGEN. Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
line 21594-->    Was near at hand. Ne'er long'd my mother so
line 21595-->    To see me first as I have now. Pisanio! Man!
line 21596-->    Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind
line 21597-->    That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
line 21598-->    From th' inward of thee? One but painted thus
line 21599-->    Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
line 21600-->    Beyond self-explication. Put thyself
line 21601-->    Into a haviour of less fear, ere wildness
line 21602-->    Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
line 21603-->    Why tender'st thou that paper to me with
line 21604-->    A look untender! If't be summer news,
line 21605-->    Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
line 21606-->    But keep that count'nance still. My husband's hand?
line 21607-->    That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
line 21608-->    And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue
line 21609-->    May take off some extremity, which to read  
line 21610-->    Would be even mortal to me.
line 21611-->  PISANIO. Please you read,
line 21612-->    And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
line 21613-->    The most disdain'd of fortune.
line 21614-->  IMOGEN. [Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play'd the strumpet in
line 21615-->    my bed, the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not
line 21616-->    out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as
line 21617-->    certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act
line 21618-->    for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let
line 21619-->    thine own hands take away her life; I shall give thee opportunity
line 21620-->    at Milford Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if
line 21621-->    thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art
line 21622-->    the pander to her dishonour, and equally to me disloyal.'
line 21623-->  PISANIO. What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper
line 21624-->    Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
line 21625-->    Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
line 21626-->    Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
line 21627-->    Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
line 21628-->    All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,
line 21629-->    Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,  
line 21630-->    This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?
line 21631-->  IMOGEN. False to his bed? What is it to be false?
line 21632-->    To lie in watch there, and to think on him?
line 21633-->    To weep twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,
line 21634-->    To break it with a fearful dream of him,
line 21635-->    And cry myself awake? That's false to's bed,
line 21636-->    Is it?
line 21637-->  PISANIO. Alas, good lady!
line 21638-->  IMOGEN. I false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,
line 21639-->    Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
line 21640-->    Thou then look'dst like a villain; now, methinks,
line 21641-->    Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy,
line 21642-->    Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him.
line 21643-->    Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,
line 21644-->    And for I am richer than to hang by th' walls
line 21645-->    I must be ripp'd. To pieces with me! O,
line 21646-->    Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
line 21647-->    By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
line 21648-->    Put on for villainy; not born where't grows,
line 21649-->    But worn a bait for ladies.  
line 21650-->  PISANIO. Good madam, hear me.
line 21651-->  IMOGEN. True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
line 21652-->    Were, in his time, thought false; and Sinon's weeping
line 21653-->    Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
line 21654-->    From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,
line 21655-->    Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men:
line 21656-->    Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd
line 21657-->    From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest;
line 21658-->    Do thou thy master's bidding; when thou seest him,
line 21659-->    A little witness my obedience. Look!
line 21660-->    I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit
line 21661-->    The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.
line 21662-->    Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
line 21663-->    Thy master is not there, who was indeed
line 21664-->    The riches of it. Do his bidding; strike.
line 21665-->    Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,
line 21666-->    But now thou seem'st a coward.
line 21667-->  PISANIO. Hence, vile instrument!
line 21668-->    Thou shalt not damn my hand.
line 21669-->  IMOGEN. Why, I must die;  
line 21670-->    And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
line 21671-->    No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
line 21672-->    There is a prohibition so divine
line 21673-->    That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart-
line 21674-->    Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence!-
line 21675-->    Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
line 21676-->    The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
line 21677-->    All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
line 21678-->    Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
line 21679-->    Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
line 21680-->    Believe false teachers; though those that are betray'd
line 21681-->    Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
line 21682-->    Stands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,
line 21683-->    That didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the King
line 21684-->    My father, and make me put into contempt the suits
line 21685-->    Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
line 21686-->    It is no act of common passage but
line 21687-->    A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
line 21688-->    To think, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her
line 21689-->    That now thou tirest on, how thy memory  
line 21690-->    Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee dispatch.
line 21691-->    The lamp entreats the butcher. Where's thy knife?
line 21692-->    Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
line 21693-->    When I desire it too.
line 21694-->  PISANIO. O gracious lady,
line 21695-->    Since I receiv'd command to do this busines
line 21696-->    I have not slept one wink.
line 21697-->  IMOGEN. Do't, and to bed then.
line 21698-->  PISANIO. I'll wake mine eyeballs first.
line 21699-->  IMOGEN. Wherefore then
line 21700-->    Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abus'd
line 21701-->    So many miles with a pretence? This place?
line 21702-->    Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
line 21703-->    The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
line 21704-->    For my being absent?- whereunto I never
line 21705-->    Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far
line 21706-->    To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
line 21707-->    Th' elected deer before thee?
line 21708-->  PISANIO. But to win time
line 21709-->    To lose so bad employment, in the which  
line 21710-->    I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
line 21711-->    Hear me with patience.
line 21712-->  IMOGEN. Talk thy tongue weary- speak.
line 21713-->    I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,
line 21714-->    Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
line 21715-->    Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
line 21716-->  PISANIO. Then, madam,
line 21717-->    I thought you would not back again.
line 21718-->  IMOGEN. Most like-
line 21719-->    Bringing me here to kill me.
line 21720-->  PISANIO. Not so, neither;
line 21721-->    But if I were as wise as honest, then
line 21722-->    My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
line 21723-->    But that my master is abus'd. Some villain,
line 21724-->    Ay, and singular in his art, hath done you both
line 21725-->    This cursed injury.
line 21726-->  IMOGEN. Some Roman courtezan!
line 21727-->  PISANIO. No, on my life!
line 21728-->    I'll give but notice you are dead, and send him
line 21729-->    Some bloody sign of it, for 'tis commanded  
line 21730-->    I should do so. You shall be miss'd at court,
line 21731-->    And that will well confirm it.
line 21732-->  IMOGEN. Why, good fellow,
line 21733-->    What shall I do the while? where bide? how live?
line 21734-->    Or in my life what comfort, when I am
line 21735-->    Dead to my husband?
line 21736-->  PISANIO. If you'll back to th' court-
line 21737-->  IMOGEN. No court, no father, nor no more ado
line 21738-->    With that harsh, noble, simple nothing-
line 21739-->    That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
line 21740-->    As fearful as a siege.
line 21741-->  PISANIO. If not at court,
line 21742-->    Then not in Britain must you bide.
line 21743-->  IMOGEN. Where then?
line 21744-->    Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
line 21745-->    Are they not but in Britain? I' th' world's volume
line 21746-->    Our Britain seems as of it, but not in't;
line 21747-->    In a great pool a swan's nest. Prithee think
line 21748-->    There's livers out of Britain.
line 21749-->  PISANIO. I am most glad  
line 21750-->    You think of other place. Th' ambassador,
line 21751-->  LUCIUS the Roman, comes to Milford Haven
line 21752-->    To-morrow. Now, if you could wear a mind
line 21753-->    Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
line 21754-->    That which t' appear itself must not yet be
line 21755-->    But by self-danger, you should tread a course
line 21756-->    Pretty and full of view; yea, happily, near
line 21757-->    The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,
line 21758-->    That though his actions were not visible, yet
line 21759-->    Report should render him hourly to your ear
line 21760-->    As truly as he moves.
line 21761-->  IMOGEN. O! for such means,
line 21762-->    Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
line 21763-->    I would adventure.
line 21764-->  PISANIO. Well then, here's the point:
line 21765-->    You must forget to be a woman; change
line 21766-->    Command into obedience; fear and niceness-
line 21767-->    The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
line 21768-->    Woman it pretty self- into a waggish courage;
line 21769-->    Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy, and  
line 21770-->    As quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must
line 21771-->    Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
line 21772-->    Exposing it- but, O, the harder heart!
line 21773-->    Alack, no remedy!- to the greedy touch
line 21774-->    Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
line 21775-->    Your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
line 21776-->    You made great Juno angry.
line 21777-->  IMOGEN. Nay, be brief;
line 21778-->    I see into thy end, and am almost
line 21779-->    A man already.
line 21780-->  PISANIO. First, make yourself but like one.
line 21781-->    Fore-thinking this, I have already fit-
line 21782-->    'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
line 21783-->    That answer to them. Would you, in their serving,
line 21784-->    And with what imitation you can borrow
line 21785-->    From youth of such a season, fore noble Lucius
line 21786-->    Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
line 21787-->    Wherein you're happy- which will make him know
line 21788-->    If that his head have ear in music; doubtless
line 21789-->    With joy he will embrace you; for he's honourable,  
line 21790-->    And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad-
line 21791-->    You have me, rich; and I will never fail
line 21792-->    Beginning nor supplyment.
line 21793-->  IMOGEN. Thou art all the comfort
line 21794-->    The gods will diet me with. Prithee away!
line 21795-->    There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
line 21796-->    All that good time will give us. This attempt
line 21797-->    I am soldier to, and will abide it with
line 21798-->    A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
line 21799-->  PISANIO. Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
line 21800-->    Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
line 21801-->    Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
line 21802-->    Here is a box; I had it from the Queen.
line 21803-->    What's in't is precious. If you are sick at sea
line 21804-->    Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
line 21805-->    Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
line 21806-->    And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
line 21807-->    Direct you to the best!
line 21808-->  IMOGEN. Amen. I thank thee.                   Exeunt severally
line 21809-->
line 21810-->
line 21811-->
line 21812-->
line 21813-->SCENE V.
line 21814-->Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace
line 21815-->
line 21816-->Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, and LORDS
line 21817-->
line 21818-->  CYMBELINE. Thus far; and so farewell.
line 21819-->  LUCIUS. Thanks, royal sir.
line 21820-->    My emperor hath wrote; I must from hence,
line 21821-->    And am right sorry that I must report ye
line 21822-->    My master's enemy.
line 21823-->  CYMBELINE. Our subjects, sir,
line 21824-->    Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself
line 21825-->    To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
line 21826-->    Appear unkinglike.
line 21827-->  LUCIUS. So, sir. I desire of you
line 21828-->    A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
line 21829-->    Madam, all joy befall your Grace, and you!
line 21830-->  CYMBELINE. My lords, you are appointed for that office;
line 21831-->    The due of honour in no point omit.
line 21832-->    So farewell, noble Lucius.
line 21833-->  LUCIUS. Your hand, my lord.
line 21834-->  CLOTEN. Receive it friendly; but from this time forth  
line 21835-->    I wear it as your enemy.
line 21836-->  LUCIUS. Sir, the event
line 21837-->    Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.
line 21838-->  CYMBELINE. Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
line 21839-->    Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
line 21840-->                                         Exeunt LUCIUS and LORDS
line 21841-->  QUEEN. He goes hence frowning; but it honours us
line 21842-->    That we have given him cause.
line 21843-->  CLOTEN. 'Tis all the better;
line 21844-->    Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
line 21845-->  CYMBELINE. Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor
line 21846-->    How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
line 21847-->    Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.
line 21848-->    The pow'rs that he already hath in Gallia
line 21849-->    Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
line 21850-->    His war for Britain.
line 21851-->  QUEEN. 'Tis not sleepy business,
line 21852-->    But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
line 21853-->  CYMBELINE. Our expectation that it would be thus
line 21854-->    Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,  
line 21855-->    Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
line 21856-->    Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
line 21857-->    The duty of the day. She looks us like
line 21858-->    A thing more made of malice than of duty;
line 21859-->    We have noted it. Call her before us, for
line 21860-->    We have been too slight in sufferance.      Exit a MESSENGER
line 21861-->  QUEEN. Royal sir,
line 21862-->    Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd
line 21863-->    Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
line 21864-->    'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
line 21865-->    Forbear sharp speeches to her; she's a lady
line 21866-->    So tender of rebukes that words are strokes,
line 21867-->    And strokes death to her.
line 21868-->
line 21869-->                 Re-enter MESSENGER
line 21870-->
line 21871-->  CYMBELINE. Where is she, sir? How
line 21872-->    Can her contempt be answer'd?
line 21873-->  MESSENGER. Please you, sir,
line 21874-->    Her chambers are all lock'd, and there's no answer  
line 21875-->    That will be given to th' loud of noise we make.
line 21876-->  QUEEN. My lord, when last I went to visit her,
line 21877-->    She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close;
line 21878-->    Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity
line 21879-->    She should that duty leave unpaid to you
line 21880-->    Which daily she was bound to proffer. This
line 21881-->    She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
line 21882-->    Made me to blame in memory.
line 21883-->  CYMBELINE. Her doors lock'd?
line 21884-->    Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
line 21885-->    Prove false!                                            Exit
line 21886-->  QUEEN. Son, I say, follow the King.
line 21887-->  CLOTEN. That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
line 21888-->    I have not seen these two days.
line 21889-->  QUEEN. Go, look after.                             Exit CLOTEN
line 21890-->    Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
line 21891-->    He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence
line 21892-->    Proceed by swallowing that; for he believes
line 21893-->    It is a thing most precious. But for her,
line 21894-->    Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz'd her;  
line 21895-->    Or, wing'd with fervour of her love, she's flown
line 21896-->    To her desir'd Posthumus. Gone she is
line 21897-->    To death or to dishonour, and my end
line 21898-->    Can make good use of either. She being down,
line 21899-->    I have the placing of the British crown.
line 21900-->
line 21901-->                   Re-enter CLOTEN
line 21902-->
line 21903-->    How now, my son?
line 21904-->  CLOTEN. 'Tis certain she is fled.
line 21905-->    Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none
line 21906-->    Dare come about him.
line 21907-->  QUEEN. All the better. May
line 21908-->    This night forestall him of the coming day!             Exit
line 21909-->  CLOTEN. I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal,
line 21910-->    And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
line 21911-->    Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one
line 21912-->    The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
line 21913-->    Outsells them all. I love her therefore; but
line 21914-->    Disdaining me and throwing favours on  
line 21915-->    The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
line 21916-->    That what's else rare is chok'd; and in that point
line 21917-->    I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
line 21918-->    To be reveng'd upon her. For when fools
line 21919-->    Shall-
line 21920-->
line 21921-->                    Enter PISANIO
line 21922-->
line 21923-->    Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
line 21924-->    Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain,
line 21925-->    Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
line 21926-->    Thou art straightway with the fiends.
line 21927-->  PISANIO. O good my lord!
line 21928-->  CLOTEN. Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter-
line 21929-->    I will not ask again. Close villain,
line 21930-->    I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
line 21931-->    Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
line 21932-->    From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
line 21933-->    A dram of worth be drawn.
line 21934-->  PISANIO. Alas, my lord,  
line 21935-->    How can she be with him? When was she miss'd?
line 21936-->    He is in Rome.
line 21937-->  CLOTEN. Where is she, sir? Come nearer.
line 21938-->    No farther halting! Satisfy me home
line 21939-->    What is become of her.
line 21940-->  PISANIO. O my all-worthy lord!
line 21941-->  CLOTEN. All-worthy villain!
line 21942-->    Discover where thy mistress is at once,
line 21943-->    At the next word. No more of 'worthy lord'!
line 21944-->    Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
line 21945-->    Thy condemnation and thy death.
line 21946-->  PISANIO. Then, sir,
line 21947-->    This paper is the history of my knowledge
line 21948-->    Touching her flight.                   [Presenting a letter]
line 21949-->  CLOTEN. Let's see't. I will pursue her
line 21950-->    Even to Augustus' throne.
line 21951-->  PISANIO. [Aside] Or this or perish.
line 21952-->    She's far enough; and what he learns by this
line 21953-->    May prove his travel, not her danger.
line 21954-->  CLOTEN. Humh!  
line 21955-->  PISANIO. [Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
line 21956-->    Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
line 21957-->  CLOTEN. Sirrah, is this letter true?
line 21958-->  PISANIO. Sir, as I think.
line 21959-->  CLOTEN. It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou wouldst
line 21960-->    not be a villain, but do me true service, undergo those
line 21961-->    employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a
line 21962-->    serious industry- that is, what villainy soe'er I bid thee do, to
line 21963-->    perform it directly and truly- I would think thee an honest man;
line 21964-->    thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice
line 21965-->    for thy preferment.
line 21966-->  PISANIO. Well, my good lord.
line 21967-->  CLOTEN. Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou
line 21968-->    hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou
line 21969-->    canst not, in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower
line 21970-->    of mine. Wilt thou serve me?
line 21971-->  PISANIO. Sir, I will.
line 21972-->  CLOTEN. Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy late
line 21973-->    master's garments in thy possession?
line 21974-->  PISANIO. I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when  
line 21975-->    he took leave of my lady and mistress.
line 21976-->  CLOTEN. The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let
line 21977-->    it be thy first service; go.
line 21978-->  PISANIO. I shall, my lord.                                Exit
line 21979-->  CLOTEN. Meet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing;
line 21980-->    I'll remember't anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I
line 21981-->    kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a
line 21982-->    time- the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart- that she
line 21983-->    held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble
line 21984-->    and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities.
line 21985-->    With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him,
line 21986-->    and in her eyes. There shall she see my valour, which will then
line 21987-->    be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of
line 21988-->    insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined-
line 21989-->    which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that
line 21990-->    she so prais'd- to the court I'll knock her back, foot her home
line 21991-->    again. She hath despis'd me rejoicingly, and I'll be merry in my
line 21992-->    revenge.
line 21993-->
line 21994-->                Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes  
line 21995-->
line 21996-->    Be those the garments?
line 21997-->  PISANIO. Ay, my noble lord.
line 21998-->  CLOTEN. How long is't since she went to Milford Haven?
line 21999-->  PISANIO. She can scarce be there yet.
line 22000-->  CLOTEN. Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing
line 22001-->    that I have commanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a
line 22002-->    voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous and true, preferment
line 22003-->    shall tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford, would
line 22004-->    I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.            Exit
line 22005-->  PISANIO. Thou bid'st me to my loss; for true to thee
line 22006-->    Were to prove false, which I will never be,
line 22007-->    To him that is most true. To Milford go,
line 22008-->    And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
line 22009-->    You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed
line 22010-->    Be cross'd with slowness! Labour be his meed!           Exit

line 22014-->
line 22015-->SCENE VI.
line 22016-->Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS
line 22017-->
line 22018-->Enter IMOGEN alone, in boy's clothes
line 22019-->
line 22020-->  IMOGEN. I see a man's life is a tedious one.
line 22021-->    I have tir'd myself, and for two nights together
line 22022-->    Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick
line 22023-->    But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
line 22024-->    When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
line 22025-->    Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think
line 22026-->    Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
line 22027-->    Where they should be reliev'd. Two beggars told me
line 22028-->    I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,
line 22029-->    That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
line 22030-->    A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
line 22031-->    When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
line 22032-->    Is sorer than to lie for need; and falsehood
line 22033-->    Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
line 22034-->    Thou art one o' th' false ones. Now I think on thee
line 22035-->    My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
line 22036-->    At point to sink for food. But what is this?  
line 22037-->    Here is a path to't; 'tis some savage hold.
line 22038-->    I were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine,
line 22039-->    Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
line 22040-->    Plenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever
line 22041-->    Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
line 22042-->    If anything that's civil, speak; if savage,
line 22043-->    Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
line 22044-->    Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy
line 22045-->    But fear the sword, like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
line 22046-->    Such a foe, good heavens!                 Exit into the cave
line 22047-->
line 22048-->            Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
line 22049-->
line 22050-->  BELARIUS. You, Polydore, have prov'd best woodman and
line 22051-->    Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I
line 22052-->    Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match.
line 22053-->    The sweat of industry would dry and die
line 22054-->    But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs
line 22055-->    Will make what's homely savoury; weariness
line 22056-->    Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth  
line 22057-->    Finds the down pillow hard. Now, peace be here,
line 22058-->    Poor house, that keep'st thyself!
line 22059-->  GUIDERIUS. I am thoroughly weary.
line 22060-->  ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
line 22061-->  GUIDERIUS. There is cold meat i' th' cave; we'll browse on that
line 22062-->    Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
line 22063-->  BELARIUS. [Looking into the cave] Stay, come not in.
line 22064-->    But that it eats our victuals, I should think
line 22065-->    Here were a fairy.
line 22066-->  GUIDERIUS. What's the matter, sir?
line 22067-->  BELARIUS.. By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
line 22068-->    An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
line 22069-->    No elder than a boy!
line 22070-->
line 22071-->                       Re-enter IMOGEN
line 22072-->
line 22073-->  IMOGEN. Good masters, harm me not.
line 22074-->    Before I enter'd here I call'd, and thought
line 22075-->    To have begg'd or bought what I have took. Good troth,
line 22076-->    I have stol'n nought; nor would not though I had found  
line 22077-->    Gold strew'd i' th' floor. Here's money for my meat.
line 22078-->    I would have left it on the board, so soon
line 22079-->    As I had made my meal, and parted
line 22080-->    With pray'rs for the provider.
line 22081-->  GUIDERIUS. Money, youth?
line 22082-->  ARVIRAGUS. All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,
line 22083-->    As 'tis no better reckon'd but of those
line 22084-->    Who worship dirty gods.
line 22085-->  IMOGEN. I see you're angry.
line 22086-->    Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
line 22087-->    Have died had I not made it.
line 22088-->  BELARIUS. Whither bound?
line 22089-->  IMOGEN. To Milford Haven.
line 22090-->  BELARIUS. What's your name?
line 22091-->  IMOGEN. Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
line 22092-->    Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
line 22093-->    To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
line 22094-->    I am fall'n in this offence.
line 22095-->  BELARIUS. Prithee, fair youth,
line 22096-->    Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds  
line 22097-->    By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!
line 22098-->    'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
line 22099-->    Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it.
line 22100-->    Boys, bid him welcome.
line 22101-->  GUIDERIUS. Were you a woman, youth,
line 22102-->    I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty
line 22103-->    I bid for you as I'd buy.
line 22104-->  ARVIRAGUS. I'll make't my comfort
line 22105-->    He is a man. I'll love him as my brother;
line 22106-->    And such a welcome as I'd give to him
line 22107-->    After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome!
line 22108-->    Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.
line 22109-->  IMOGEN. 'Mongst friends,
line 22110-->    If brothers. [Aside] Would it had been so that they
line 22111-->    Had been my father's sons! Then had my prize
line 22112-->    Been less, and so more equal ballasting
line 22113-->    To thee, Posthumus.
line 22114-->  BELARIUS. He wrings at some distress.
line 22115-->  GUIDERIUS. Would I could free't!
line 22116-->  ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate'er it be,  
line 22117-->    What pain it cost, what danger! Gods!
line 22118-->  BELARIUS. [Whispering] Hark, boys.
line 22119-->  IMOGEN. [Aside] Great men,
line 22120-->    That had a court no bigger than this cave,
line 22121-->    That did attend themselves, and had the virtue
line 22122-->    Which their own conscience seal'd them, laying by
line 22123-->    That nothing-gift of differing multitudes,
line 22124-->    Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
line 22125-->    I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
line 22126-->    Since Leonatus' false.
line 22127-->  BELARIUS. It shall be so.
line 22128-->    Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in.
line 22129-->    Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,
line 22130-->    We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
line 22131-->    So far as thou wilt speak it.
line 22132-->  GUIDERIUS. Pray draw near.
line 22133-->  ARVIRAGUS. The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less welcome.
line 22134-->  IMOGEN. Thanks, sir.
line 22135-->  ARVIRAGUS. I pray draw near.                            Exeunt
line 22136-->
line 22137-->
line 22138-->
line 22139-->
line 22140-->SCENE VII.
line 22141-->Rome. A public place
line 22142-->
line 22143-->Enter two ROMAN SENATORS and TRIBUNES
line 22144-->
line 22145-->  FIRST SENATOR. This is the tenour of the Emperor's writ:
line 22146-->    That since the common men are now in action
line 22147-->    'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
line 22148-->    And that the legions now in Gallia are
line 22149-->    Full weak to undertake our wars against
line 22150-->    The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
line 22151-->    The gentry to this business. He creates
line 22152-->    Lucius proconsul; and to you, the tribunes,
line 22153-->    For this immediate levy, he commands
line 22154-->    His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
line 22155-->  TRIBUNE. Is Lucius general of the forces?
line 22156-->  SECOND SENATOR. Ay.
line 22157-->  TRIBUNE. Remaining now in Gallia?
line 22158-->  FIRST SENATOR. With those legions
line 22159-->    Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
line 22160-->    Must be supplyant. The words of your commission
line 22161-->    Will tie you to the numbers and the time  
line 22162-->    Of their dispatch.
line 22163-->  TRIBUNE. We will discharge our duty.                    Exeunt
line 22164-->
line 22165-->
line 22166-->
line 22167-->
line 22168-->ACT IV. SCENE I.
line 22169-->Wales. Near the cave of BELARIUS
line 22170-->
line 22171-->Enter CLOTEN alone
line 22172-->
line 22173-->  CLOTEN. I am near to th' place where they should meet, if Pisanio
line 22174-->    have mapp'd it truly. How fit his garments serve me! Why should
line 22175-->    his mistress, who was made by him that made the tailor, not be
line 22176-->    fit too? The rather- saving reverence of the word- for 'tis said
line 22177-->    a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must play the workman.
line 22178-->    I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vain-glory for a man and
line 22179-->    his glass to confer in his own chamber- I mean, the lines of my
line 22180-->    body are as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, not
line 22181-->    beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time,
line 22182-->    above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and
line 22183-->    more remarkable in single oppositions. Yet this imperceiverant
line 22184-->    thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy
line 22185-->    head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this
line 22186-->    hour be off; thy mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces
line 22187-->    before her face; and all this done, spurn her home to her father,
line 22188-->    who may, haply, be a little angry for my so rough usage; but my
line 22189-->    mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my  
line 22190-->    commendations. My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword, and to a
line 22191-->    sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand. This is the very
line 22192-->    description of their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not
line 22193-->    deceive me.                                             Exit
line 22194-->
line 22195-->
line 22196-->
line 22197-->
line 22198-->SCENE II.
line 22199-->Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS
line 22200-->
line 22201-->Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN
line 22202-->
line 22203-->  BELARIUS. [To IMOGEN] You are not well. Remain here in the cave;
line 22204-->    We'll come to you after hunting.
line 22205-->  ARVIRAGUS. [To IMOGEN] Brother, stay here.
line 22206-->    Are we not brothers?
line 22207-->  IMOGEN. So man and man should be;
line 22208-->    But clay and clay differs in dignity,
line 22209-->    Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
line 22210-->  GUIDERIUS. Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
line 22211-->  IMOGEN. So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
line 22212-->    But not so citizen a wanton as
line 22213-->    To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me;
line 22214-->    Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom
line 22215-->    Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
line 22216-->    Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
line 22217-->    To one not sociable. I am not very sick,
line 22218-->    Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here.  
line 22219-->    I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
line 22220-->    Stealing so poorly.
line 22221-->  GUIDERIUS. I love thee; I have spoke it.
line 22222-->    How much the quantity, the weight as much
line 22223-->    As I do love my father.
line 22224-->  BELARIUS. What? how? how?
line 22225-->  ARVIRAGUS. If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me
line 22226-->    In my good brother's fault. I know not why
line 22227-->    I love this youth, and I have heard you say
line 22228-->    Love's reason's without reason. The bier at door,
line 22229-->    And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
line 22230-->    'My father, not this youth.'
line 22231-->  BELARIUS. [Aside] O noble strain!
line 22232-->    O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
line 22233-->    Cowards father cowards and base things sire base.
line 22234-->    Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
line 22235-->    I'm not their father; yet who this should be
line 22236-->    Doth miracle itself, lov'd before me.-
line 22237-->    'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.
line 22238-->  ARVIRAGUS. Brother, farewell.  
line 22239-->  IMOGEN. I wish ye sport.
line 22240-->  ARVIRAGUS. Your health. [To BELARIUS] So please you, sir.
line 22241-->  IMOGEN. [Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have
line 22242-->      heard!
line 22243-->    Our courtiers say all's savage but at court.
line 22244-->    Experience, O, thou disprov'st report!
line 22245-->    Th' imperious seas breed monsters; for the dish,
line 22246-->    Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
line 22247-->    I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,
line 22248-->    I'll now taste of thy drug.                  [Swallows some]
line 22249-->  GUIDERIUS. I could not stir him.
line 22250-->    He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
line 22251-->    Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.
line 22252-->  ARVIRAGUS. Thus did he answer me; yet said hereafter
line 22253-->    I might know more.
line 22254-->  BELARIUS. To th' field, to th' field!
line 22255-->    We'll leave you for this time. Go in and rest.
line 22256-->  ARVIRAGUS. We'll not be long away.
line 22257-->  BELARIUS. Pray be not sick,
line 22258-->    For you must be our huswife.  
line 22259-->  IMOGEN. Well, or ill,
line 22260-->    I am bound to you.
line 22261-->  BELARIUS. And shalt be ever.         Exit IMOGEN into the cave
line 22262-->    This youth, howe'er distress'd, appears he hath had
line 22263-->    Good ancestors.
line 22264-->  ARVIRAGUS. How angel-like he sings!
line 22265-->  GUIDERIUS. But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters,
line 22266-->    And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick,
line 22267-->    And he her dieter.
line 22268-->  ARVIRAGUS. Nobly he yokes
line 22269-->    A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
line 22270-->    Was that it was for not being such a smile;
line 22271-->    The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
line 22272-->    From so divine a temple to commix
line 22273-->    With winds that sailors rail at.
line 22274-->  GUIDERIUS. I do note
line 22275-->    That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
line 22276-->    Mingle their spurs together.
line 22277-->  ARVIRAGUS. Grow patience!
line 22278-->    And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine  
line 22279-->    His perishing root with the increasing vine!
line 22280-->  BELARIUS. It is great morning. Come, away! Who's there?
line 22281-->
line 22282-->                      Enter CLOTEN
line 22283-->
line 22284-->  CLOTEN. I cannot find those runagates; that villain
line 22285-->    Hath mock'd me. I am faint.
line 22286-->  BELARIUS. Those runagates?
line 22287-->    Means he not us? I partly know him; 'tis
line 22288-->    Cloten, the son o' th' Queen. I fear some ambush.
line 22289-->    I saw him not these many years, and yet
line 22290-->    I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!
line 22291-->  GUIDERIUS. He is but one; you and my brother search
line 22292-->    What companies are near. Pray you away;
line 22293-->    Let me alone with him.         Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
line 22294-->  CLOTEN. Soft! What are you
line 22295-->    That fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?
line 22296-->    I have heard of such. What slave art thou?
line 22297-->  GUIDERIUS. A thing
line 22298-->    More slavish did I ne'er than answering  
line 22299-->    'A slave' without a knock.
line 22300-->  CLOTEN. Thou art a robber,
line 22301-->    A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
line 22302-->  GUIDERIUS. To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I
line 22303-->    An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?
line 22304-->    Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
line 22305-->    My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art;
line 22306-->    Why I should yield to thee.
line 22307-->  CLOTEN. Thou villain base,
line 22308-->    Know'st me not by my clothes?
line 22309-->  GUIDERIUS. No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
line 22310-->    Who is thy grandfather; he made those clothes,
line 22311-->    Which, as it seems, make thee.
line 22312-->  CLOTEN. Thou precious varlet,
line 22313-->    My tailor made them not.
line 22314-->  GUIDERIUS. Hence, then, and thank
line 22315-->    The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
line 22316-->    I am loath to beat thee.
line 22317-->  CLOTEN. Thou injurious thief,
line 22318-->    Hear but my name, and tremble.  
line 22319-->  GUIDERIUS. What's thy name?
line 22320-->  CLOTEN. Cloten, thou villain.
line 22321-->  GUIDERIUS. Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
line 22322-->    I cannot tremble at it. Were it toad, or adder, spider,
line 22323-->    'Twould move me sooner.
line 22324-->  CLOTEN. To thy further fear,
line 22325-->    Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
line 22326-->    I am son to th' Queen.
line 22327-->  GUIDERIUS. I'm sorry for't; not seeming
line 22328-->    So worthy as thy birth.
line 22329-->  CLOTEN. Art not afeard?
line 22330-->  GUIDERIUS. Those that I reverence, those I fear- the wise:
line 22331-->    At fools I laugh, not fear them.
line 22332-->  CLOTEN. Die the death.
line 22333-->    When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
line 22334-->    I'll follow those that even now fled hence,
line 22335-->    And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads.
line 22336-->    Yield, rustic mountaineer.                  Exeunt, fighting
line 22337-->
line 22338-->                Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS  
line 22339-->
line 22340-->  BELARIUS. No company's abroad.
line 22341-->  ARVIRAGUS. None in the world; you did mistake him, sure.
line 22342-->  BELARIUS. I cannot tell; long is it since I saw him,
line 22343-->    But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
line 22344-->    Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
line 22345-->    And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute
line 22346-->    'Twas very Cloten.
line 22347-->  ARVIRAGUS. In this place we left them.
line 22348-->    I wish my brother make good time with him,
line 22349-->    You say he is so fell.
line 22350-->  BELARIUS. Being scarce made up,
line 22351-->    I mean to man, he had not apprehension
line 22352-->    Or roaring terrors; for defect of judgment
line 22353-->    Is oft the cease of fear.
line 22354-->
line 22355-->              Re-enter GUIDERIUS with CLOTEN'S head
line 22356-->
line 22357-->    But, see, thy brother.
line 22358-->  GUIDERIUS. This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;  
line 22359-->    There was no money in't. Not Hercules
line 22360-->    Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none;
line 22361-->    Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
line 22362-->    My head as I do his.
line 22363-->  BELARIUS. What hast thou done?
line 22364-->  GUIDERIUS. I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
line 22365-->    Son to the Queen, after his own report;
line 22366-->    Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
line 22367-->    With his own single hand he'd take us in,
line 22368-->    Displace our heads where- thank the gods!- they grow,
line 22369-->    And set them on Lud's Town.
line 22370-->  BELARIUS. We are all undone.
line 22371-->  GUIDERIUS. Why, worthy father, what have we to lose
line 22372-->    But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
line 22373-->    Protects not us; then why should we be tender
line 22374-->    To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
line 22375-->    Play judge and executioner all himself,
line 22376-->    For we do fear the law? What company
line 22377-->    Discover you abroad?
line 22378-->  BELARIUS. No single soul  
line 22379-->    Can we set eye on, but in an safe reason
line 22380-->    He must have some attendants. Though his humour
line 22381-->    Was nothing but mutation- ay, and that
line 22382-->    From one bad thing to worse- not frenzy, not
line 22383-->    Absolute madness could so far have rav'd,
line 22384-->    To bring him here alone. Although perhaps
line 22385-->    It may be heard at court that such as we
line 22386-->    Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
line 22387-->    May make some stronger head- the which he hearing,
line 22388-->    As it is like him, might break out and swear
line 22389-->    He'd fetch us in; yet is't not probable
line 22390-->    To come alone, either he so undertaking
line 22391-->    Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,
line 22392-->    If we do fear this body hath a tail
line 22393-->    More perilous than the head.
line 22394-->  ARVIRAGUS. Let ordinance
line 22395-->    Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe'er,
line 22396-->    My brother hath done well.
line 22397-->  BELARIUS. I had no mind
line 22398-->    To hunt this day; the boy Fidele's sickness  
line 22399-->    Did make my way long forth.
line 22400-->  GUIDERIUS. With his own sword,
line 22401-->    Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
line 22402-->    His head from him. I'll throw't into the creek
line 22403-->    Behind our rock, and let it to the sea
line 22404-->    And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten.
line 22405-->    That's all I reck.                                      Exit
line 22406-->  BELARIUS. I fear'twill be reveng'd.
line 22407-->    Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done't! though valour
line 22408-->    Becomes thee well enough.
line 22409-->  ARVIRAGUS. Would I had done't,
line 22410-->    So the revenge alone pursu'd me! Polydore,
line 22411-->    I love thee brotherly, but envy much
line 22412-->    Thou hast robb'd me of this deed. I would revenges,
line 22413-->    That possible strength might meet, would seek us through,
line 22414-->    And put us to our answer.
line 22415-->  BELARIUS. Well, 'tis done.
line 22416-->    We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
line 22417-->    Where there's no profit. I prithee to our rock.
line 22418-->    You and Fidele play the cooks; I'll stay  
line 22419-->    Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him
line 22420-->    To dinner presently.
line 22421-->  ARVIRAGUS. Poor sick Fidele!
line 22422-->    I'll willingly to him; to gain his colour
line 22423-->    I'd let a parish of such Cloten's blood,
line 22424-->    And praise myself for charity.                          Exit
line 22425-->  BELARIUS. O thou goddess,
line 22426-->    Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon'st
line 22427-->    In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
line 22428-->    As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
line 22429-->    Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
line 22430-->    Their royal blood enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind
line 22431-->    That by the top doth take the mountain pine
line 22432-->    And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis wonder
line 22433-->    That an invisible instinct should frame them
line 22434-->    To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,
line 22435-->    Civility not seen from other, valour
line 22436-->    That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
line 22437-->    As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
line 22438-->    What Cloten's being here to us portends,  
line 22439-->    Or what his death will bring us.
line 22440-->
line 22441-->                    Re-enter GUIDERIUS
line 22442-->
line 22443-->  GUIDERIUS. Where's my brother?
line 22444-->    I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
line 22445-->    In embassy to his mother; his body's hostage
line 22446-->    For his return.                               [Solemn music]
line 22447-->  BELARIUS. My ingenious instrument!
line 22448-->    Hark, Polydore, it sounds. But what occasion
line 22449-->    Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
line 22450-->  GUIDERIUS. Is he at home?
line 22451-->  BELARIUS. He went hence even now.
line 22452-->  GUIDERIUS. What does he mean? Since death of my dear'st mother
line 22453-->    It did not speak before. All solemn things
line 22454-->    Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
line 22455-->    Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
line 22456-->    Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
line 22457-->    Is Cadwal mad?
line 22458-->  
line 22459-->       Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN as dead, bearing
line 22460-->                         her in his arms
line 22461-->
line 22462-->  BELARIUS. Look, here he comes,
line 22463-->    And brings the dire occasion in his arms
line 22464-->    Of what we blame him for!
line 22465-->  ARVIRAGUS. The bird is dead
line 22466-->    That we have made so much on. I had rather
line 22467-->    Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
line 22468-->    To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch,
line 22469-->    Than have seen this.
line 22470-->  GUIDERIUS. O sweetest, fairest lily!
line 22471-->    My brother wears thee not the one half so well
line 22472-->    As when thou grew'st thyself.
line 22473-->  BELARIUS. O melancholy!
line 22474-->    Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
line 22475-->    The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
line 22476-->    Might'st easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
line 22477-->    Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
line 22478-->    Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.  
line 22479-->    How found you him?
line 22480-->  ARVIRAGUS. Stark, as you see;
line 22481-->    Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
line 22482-->    Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his right cheek
line 22483-->    Reposing on a cushion.
line 22484-->  GUIDERIUS. Where?
line 22485-->  ARVIRAGUS. O' th' floor;
line 22486-->    His arms thus leagu'd. I thought he slept, and put
line 22487-->    My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
line 22488-->    Answer'd my steps too loud.
line 22489-->  GUIDERIUS. Why, he but sleeps.
line 22490-->    If he be gone he'll make his grave a bed;
line 22491-->    With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
line 22492-->    And worms will not come to thee.
line 22493-->  ARVIRAGUS. With fairest flowers,
line 22494-->    Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
line 22495-->    I'll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack
line 22496-->    The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor
line 22497-->    The azur'd hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor
line 22498-->    The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,  
line 22499-->    Out-sweet'ned not thy breath. The ruddock would,
line 22500-->    With charitable bill- O bill, sore shaming
line 22501-->    Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
line 22502-->    Without a monument!- bring thee all this;
line 22503-->    Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flow'rs are none,
line 22504-->    To winter-ground thy corse-
line 22505-->  GUIDERIUS. Prithee have done,
line 22506-->    And do not play in wench-like words with that
line 22507-->    Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
line 22508-->    And not protract with admiration what
line 22509-->    Is now due debt. To th' grave.
line 22510-->  ARVIRAGUS. Say, where shall's lay him?
line 22511-->  GUIDERIUS. By good Euriphile, our mother.
line 22512-->  ARVIRAGUS. Be't so;
line 22513-->    And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
line 22514-->    Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th' ground,
line 22515-->    As once to our mother; use like note and words,
line 22516-->    Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
line 22517-->  GUIDERIUS. Cadwal,
line 22518-->    I cannot sing. I'll weep, and word it with thee;  
line 22519-->    For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
line 22520-->    Than priests and fanes that lie.
line 22521-->  ARVIRAGUS. We'll speak it, then.
line 22522-->  BELARIUS. Great griefs, I see, med'cine the less, for Cloten
line 22523-->    Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
line 22524-->    And though he came our enemy, remember
line 22525-->    He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty rotting
line 22526-->    Together have one dust, yet reverence-
line 22527-->    That angel of the world- doth make distinction
line 22528-->    Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely;
line 22529-->    And though you took his life, as being our foe,
line 22530-->    Yet bury him as a prince.
line 22531-->  GUIDERIUS. Pray you fetch him hither.
line 22532-->    Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
line 22533-->    When neither are alive.
line 22534-->  ARVIRAGUS. If you'll go fetch him,
line 22535-->    We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.
line 22536-->                                                   Exit BELARIUS
line 22537-->  GUIDERIUS. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th' East;
line 22538-->    My father hath a reason for't.  
line 22539-->  ARVIRAGUS. 'Tis true.
line 22540-->  GUIDERIUS. Come on, then, and remove him.
line 22541-->  ARVIRAGUS. So. Begin.
line 22542-->
line 22543-->                      SONG
line 22544-->
line 22545-->  GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the heat o' th' sun
line 22546-->               Nor the furious winter's rages;
line 22547-->             Thou thy worldly task hast done,
line 22548-->               Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.
line 22549-->             Golden lads and girls all must,
line 22550-->             As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.
line 22551-->
line 22552-->  ARVIRAGUS. Fear no more the frown o' th' great;
line 22553-->               Thou art past the tyrant's stroke.
line 22554-->             Care no more to clothe and eat;
line 22555-->               To thee the reed is as the oak.
line 22556-->             The sceptre, learning, physic, must
line 22557-->             All follow this and come to dust.
line 22558-->  
line 22559-->  GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the lightning flash,
line 22560-->  ARVIRAGUS.   Nor th' all-dreaded thunder-stone;
line 22561-->  GUIDERIUS. Fear not slander, censure rash;
line 22562-->  ARVIRAGUS.   Thou hast finish'd joy and moan.
line 22563-->  BOTH.      All lovers young, all lovers must
line 22564-->             Consign to thee and come to dust.
line 22565-->
line 22566-->  GUIDERIUS. No exorciser harm thee!
line 22567-->  ARVIRAGUS. Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
line 22568-->  GUIDERIUS. Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
line 22569-->  ARVIRAGUS. Nothing ill come near thee!
line 22570-->  BOTH.      Quiet consummation have,
line 22571-->             And renowned be thy grave!
line 22572-->
line 22573-->         Re-enter BELARIUS with the body of CLOTEN
line 22574-->
line 22575-->  GUIDERIUS. We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.
line 22576-->  BELARIUS. Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more.
line 22577-->    The herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' night
line 22578-->    Are strewings fit'st for graves. Upon their faces.  
line 22579-->    You were as flow'rs, now wither'd. Even so
line 22580-->    These herblets shall which we upon you strew.
line 22581-->    Come on, away. Apart upon our knees.
line 22582-->    The ground that gave them first has them again.
line 22583-->    Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.
line 22584-->                                           Exeunt all but IMOGEN
line 22585-->  IMOGEN. [Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way?
line 22586-->    I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?
line 22587-->    'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?
line 22588-->    I have gone all night. Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
line 22589-->    But, soft! no bedfellow. O gods and goddesses!
line 22590-->                                               [Seeing the body]
line 22591-->    These flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world;
line 22592-->    This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;
line 22593-->    For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
line 22594-->    And cook to honest creatures. But 'tis not so;
line 22595-->    'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
line 22596-->    Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes
line 22597-->    Are sometimes, like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
line 22598-->    I tremble still with fear; but if there be  
line 22599-->    Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
line 22600-->    As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
line 22601-->    The dream's here still. Even when I wake it is
line 22602-->    Without me, as within me; not imagin'd, felt.
line 22603-->    A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
line 22604-->    I know the shape of's leg; this is his hand,
line 22605-->    His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,
line 22606-->    The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face-
line 22607-->    Murder in heaven! How! 'Tis gone. Pisanio,
line 22608-->    All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
line 22609-->    And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
line 22610-->    Conspir'd with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
line 22611-->    Hath here cut off my lord. To write and read
line 22612-->    Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
line 22613-->    Hath with his forged letters- damn'd Pisanio-
line 22614-->    From this most bravest vessel of the world
line 22615-->    Struck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas,
line 22616-->    Where is thy head? Where's that? Ay me! where's that?
line 22617-->    Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
line 22618-->    And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?  
line 22619-->    'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
line 22620-->    Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
line 22621-->    The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
line 22622-->    And cordial to me, have I not found it
line 22623-->    Murd'rous to th' senses? That confirms it home.
line 22624-->    This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten. O!
line 22625-->    Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
line 22626-->    That we the horrider may seem to those
line 22627-->    Which chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord!
line 22628-->                                    [Falls fainting on the body]
line 22629-->
line 22630-->           Enter LUCIUS, CAPTAINS, and a SOOTHSAYER
line 22631-->
line 22632-->  CAPTAIN. To them the legions garrison'd in Gallia,
line 22633-->    After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
line 22634-->    You here at Milford Haven; with your ships,
line 22635-->    They are in readiness.
line 22636-->  LUCIUS. But what from Rome?
line 22637-->  CAPTAIN. The Senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
line 22638-->    And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,  
line 22639-->    That promise noble service; and they come
line 22640-->    Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
line 22641-->    Sienna's brother.
line 22642-->  LUCIUS. When expect you them?
line 22643-->  CAPTAIN. With the next benefit o' th' wind.
line 22644-->  LUCIUS. This forwardness
line 22645-->    Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
line 22646-->    Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,
line 22647-->    What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?
line 22648-->  SOOTHSAYER. Last night the very gods show'd me a vision-
line 22649-->    I fast and pray'd for their intelligence- thus:
line 22650-->    I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
line 22651-->    From the spongy south to this part of the west,
line 22652-->    There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which portends,
line 22653-->    Unless my sins abuse my divination,
line 22654-->    Success to th' Roman host.
line 22655-->  LUCIUS. Dream often so,
line 22656-->    And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
line 22657-->    Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
line 22658-->    It was a worthy building. How? a page?  
line 22659-->    Or dead or sleeping on him? But dead, rather;
line 22660-->    For nature doth abhor to make his bed
line 22661-->    With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
line 22662-->    Let's see the boy's face.
line 22663-->  CAPTAIN. He's alive, my lord.
line 22664-->  LUCIUS. He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
line 22665-->    Inform us of thy fortunes; for it seems
line 22666-->    They crave to be demanded. Who is this
line 22667-->    Thou mak'st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
line 22668-->    That, otherwise than noble nature did,
line 22669-->    Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest
line 22670-->    In this sad wreck? How came't? Who is't? What art thou?
line 22671-->  IMOGEN. I am nothing; or if not,
line 22672-->    Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
line 22673-->    A very valiant Briton and a good,
line 22674-->    That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
line 22675-->    There is no more such masters. I may wander
line 22676-->    From east to occident; cry out for service;
line 22677-->    Try many, all good; serve truly; never
line 22678-->    Find such another master.  
line 22679-->  LUCIUS. 'Lack, good youth!
line 22680-->    Thou mov'st no less with thy complaining than
line 22681-->    Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.
line 22682-->  IMOGEN. Richard du Champ. [Aside] If I do lie, and do
line 22683-->    No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
line 22684-->    They'll pardon it.- Say you, sir?
line 22685-->  LUCIUS. Thy name?
line 22686-->  IMOGEN. Fidele, sir.
line 22687-->  LUCIUS. Thou dost approve thyself the very same;
line 22688-->    Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
line 22689-->    Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
line 22690-->    Thou shalt be so well master'd; but, be sure,
line 22691-->    No less belov'd. The Roman Emperor's letters,
line 22692-->    Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
line 22693-->    Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.
line 22694-->  IMOGEN. I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,
line 22695-->    I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
line 22696-->    As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
line 22697-->    With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,
line 22698-->    And on it said a century of prayers,  
line 22699-->    Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
line 22700-->    And leaving so his service, follow you,
line 22701-->    So please you entertain me.
line 22702-->  LUCIUS. Ay, good youth;
line 22703-->    And rather father thee than master thee.
line 22704-->    My friends,
line 22705-->    The boy hath taught us manly duties; let us
line 22706-->    Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
line 22707-->    And make him with our pikes and partisans
line 22708-->    A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
line 22709-->    By thee to us; and he shall be interr'd
line 22710-->    As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.
line 22711-->    Some falls are means the happier to arise.            Exeunt
line 22712-->

line 22716-->SCENE III.
line 22717-->Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace
line 22718-->
line 22719-->Enter CYMBELINE, LORDS, PISANIO, and attendants
line 22720-->
line 22721-->  CYMBELINE. Again! and bring me word how 'tis with her.
line 22722-->                                               Exit an attendant
line 22723-->    A fever with the absence of her son;
line 22724-->    A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
line 22725-->    How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
line 22726-->    The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
line 22727-->    Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
line 22728-->    When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
line 22729-->    So needful for this present. It strikes me past
line 22730-->    The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
line 22731-->    Who needs must know of her departure and
line 22732-->    Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
line 22733-->    By a sharp torture.
line 22734-->  PISANIO. Sir, my life is yours;
line 22735-->    I humbly set it at your will; but for my mistress,
line 22736-->    I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
line 22737-->    Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your Highness,  
line 22738-->    Hold me your loyal servant.
line 22739-->  LORD. Good my liege,
line 22740-->    The day that she was missing he was here.
line 22741-->    I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
line 22742-->    All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
line 22743-->    There wants no diligence in seeking him,
line 22744-->    And will no doubt be found.
line 22745-->  CYMBELINE. The time is troublesome.
line 22746-->    [To PISANIO] We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
line 22747-->    Does yet depend.
line 22748-->  LORD. So please your Majesty,
line 22749-->    The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
line 22750-->    Are landed on your coast, with a supply
line 22751-->    Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent.
line 22752-->  CYMBELINE. Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
line 22753-->    I am amaz'd with matter.
line 22754-->  LORD. Good my liege,
line 22755-->    Your preparation can affront no less
line 22756-->    Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you're ready.
line 22757-->    The want is but to put those pow'rs in motion  
line 22758-->    That long to move.
line 22759-->  CYMBELINE. I thank you. Let's withdraw,
line 22760-->    And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
line 22761-->    What can from Italy annoy us; but
line 22762-->    We grieve at chances here. Away!      Exeunt all but PISANIO
line 22763-->  PISANIO. I heard no letter from my master since
line 22764-->    I wrote him Imogen was slain. 'Tis strange.
line 22765-->    Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise
line 22766-->    To yield me often tidings. Neither know
line 22767-->    What is betid to Cloten, but remain
line 22768-->    Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
line 22769-->    Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.
line 22770-->    These present wars shall find I love my country,
line 22771-->    Even to the note o' th' King, or I'll fall in them.
line 22772-->    All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:
line 22773-->    Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.      Exit
line 22774-->
line 22775-->
line 22776-->
line 22777-->
line 22778-->SCENE IV.
line 22779-->Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS
line 22780-->
line 22781-->Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
line 22782-->
line 22783-->  GUIDERIUS. The noise is round about us.
line 22784-->  BELARIUS. Let us from it.
line 22785-->  ARVIRAGUS. What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
line 22786-->    From action and adventure?
line 22787-->  GUIDERIUS. Nay, what hope
line 22788-->    Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans
line 22789-->    Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
line 22790-->    For barbarous and unnatural revolts
line 22791-->    During their use, and slay us after.
line 22792-->  BELARIUS. Sons,
line 22793-->    We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
line 22794-->    To the King's party there's no going. Newness
line 22795-->    Of Cloten's death- we being not known, not muster'd
line 22796-->    Among the bands-may drive us to a render
line 22797-->    Where we have liv'd, and so extort from's that
line 22798-->    Which we have done, whose answer would be death,
line 22799-->    Drawn on with torture.  
line 22800-->  GUIDERIUS. This is, sir, a doubt
line 22801-->    In such a time nothing becoming you
line 22802-->    Nor satisfying us.
line 22803-->  ARVIRAGUS. It is not likely
line 22804-->    That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
line 22805-->    Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes
line 22806-->    And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
line 22807-->    That they will waste their time upon our note,
line 22808-->    To know from whence we are.
line 22809-->  BELARIUS. O, I am known
line 22810-->    Of many in the army. Many years,
line 22811-->    Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
line 22812-->    From my remembrance. And, besides, the King
line 22813-->    Hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves,
line 22814-->    Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
line 22815-->    The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
line 22816-->    To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd,
line 22817-->    But to be still hot summer's tanlings and
line 22818-->    The shrinking slaves of winter.
line 22819-->  GUIDERIUS. Than be so,  
line 22820-->    Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th' army.
line 22821-->    I and my brother are not known; yourself
line 22822-->    So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
line 22823-->    Cannot be questioned.
line 22824-->  ARVIRAGUS. By this sun that shines,
line 22825-->    I'll thither. What thing is't that I never
line 22826-->    Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood
line 22827-->    But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
line 22828-->    Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
line 22829-->    A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
line 22830-->    Nor iron on his heel! I am asham'd
line 22831-->    To look upon the holy sun, to have
line 22832-->    The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
line 22833-->    So long a poor unknown.
line 22834-->  GUIDERIUS. By heavens, I'll go!
line 22835-->    If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
line 22836-->    I'll take the better care; but if you will not,
line 22837-->    The hazard therefore due fall on me by
line 22838-->    The hands of Romans!
line 22839-->  ARVIRAGUS. So say I. Amen.  
line 22840-->  BELARIUS. No reason I, since of your lives you set
line 22841-->    So slight a valuation, should reserve
line 22842-->    My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!
line 22843-->    If in your country wars you chance to die,
line 22844-->    That is my bed too, lads, and there I'll lie.
line 22845-->    Lead, lead. [Aside] The time seems long; their blood thinks scorn
line 22846-->    Till it fly out and show them princes born.           Exeunt

line 22861-->
line 22862-->ACT V. SCENE I.
line 22863-->Britain. The Roman camp
line 22864-->
line 22865-->Enter POSTHUMUS alone, with a bloody handkerchief
line 22866-->
line 22867-->  POSTHUMUS. Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee; for I wish'd
line 22868-->    Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
line 22869-->    If each of you should take this course, how many
line 22870-->    Must murder wives much better than themselves
line 22871-->    For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
line 22872-->    Every good servant does not all commands;
line 22873-->    No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
line 22874-->    Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
line 22875-->    Had liv'd to put on this; so had you saved
line 22876-->    The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
line 22877-->    Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack,
line 22878-->    You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
line 22879-->    To have them fall no more. You some permit
line 22880-->    To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
line 22881-->    And make them dread it, to the doer's thrift.
line 22882-->    But Imogen is your own. Do your best wills,
line 22883-->    And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither  
line 22884-->    Among th' Italian gentry, and to fight
line 22885-->    Against my lady's kingdom. 'Tis enough
line 22886-->    That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!
line 22887-->    I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
line 22888-->    Hear patiently my purpose. I'll disrobe me
line 22889-->    Of these Italian weeds, and suit myself
line 22890-->    As does a Britain peasant. So I'll fight
line 22891-->    Against the part I come with; so I'll die
line 22892-->    For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
line 22893-->    Is every breath a death. And thus unknown,
line 22894-->    Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
line 22895-->    Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
line 22896-->    More valour in me than my habits show.
line 22897-->    Gods, put the strength o' th' Leonati in me!
line 22898-->    To shame the guise o' th' world, I will begin
line 22899-->    The fashion- less without and more within.              Exit
line 22900-->
line 22901-->
line 22902-->
line 22903-->
line 22904-->SCENE II.
line 22905-->Britain. A field of battle between the British and Roman camps
line 22906-->
line 22907-->Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman army at one door, and the British army
line 22908-->at another, LEONATUS POSTHUMUS following like a poor soldier.
line 22909-->They march over and go out.  Alarums.  Then enter again, in skirmish,
line 22910-->IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS.  He vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO,
line 22911-->and then leaves him
line 22912-->
line 22913-->  IACHIMO. The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
line 22914-->    Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,
line 22915-->    The Princess of this country, and the air on't
line 22916-->    Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
line 22917-->    A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
line 22918-->    In my profession? Knighthoods and honours borne
line 22919-->    As I wear mine are titles but of scorn.
line 22920-->    If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
line 22921-->    This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
line 22922-->    Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods.            Exit
line 22923-->
line 22924-->    The battle continues; the BRITONS fly; CYMBELINE is taken.
line 22925-->    Then enter to his rescue BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS  
line 22926-->
line 22927-->  BELARIUS. Stand, stand! We have th' advantage of the ground;
line 22928-->    The lane is guarded; nothing routs us but
line 22929-->    The villainy of our fears.
line 22930-->  GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS. Stand, stand, and fight!
line 22931-->
line 22932-->    Re-enter POSTHUMUS, and seconds the Britons; they rescue
line 22933-->    CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS and IACHIMO,
line 22934-->                         with IMOGEN
line 22935-->
line 22936-->  LUCIUS. Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
line 22937-->    For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
line 22938-->    As war were hoodwink'd.
line 22939-->  IACHIMO. 'Tis their fresh supplies.
line 22940-->  LUCIUS. It is a day turn'd strangely. Or betimes
line 22941-->    Let's reinforce or fly.                               Exeunt
line 22942-->
line 22943-->
line 22944-->
line 22945-->
line 22946-->SCENE III.
line 22947-->Another part of the field
line 22948-->
line 22949-->Enter POSTHUMUS and a Britain LORD
line 22950-->
line 22951-->  LORD. Cam'st thou from where they made the stand?
line 22952-->  POSTHUMUS. I did:
line 22953-->    Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
line 22954-->  LORD. I did.
line 22955-->  POSTHUMUS. No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,
line 22956-->    But that the heavens fought. The King himself
line 22957-->    Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
line 22958-->    And but the backs of Britons seen, an flying,
line 22959-->    Through a strait lane- the enemy, full-hearted,
line 22960-->    Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring, having work
line 22961-->    More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
line 22962-->    Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
line 22963-->    Merely through fear, that the strait pass was damm'd
line 22964-->    With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
line 22965-->    To die with length'ned shame.
line 22966-->  LORD. Where was this lane?
line 22967-->  POSTHUMUS. Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf,  
line 22968-->    Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier-
line 22969-->    An honest one, I warrant, who deserv'd
line 22970-->    So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
line 22971-->    In doing this for's country. Athwart the lane
line 22972-->    He, with two striplings- lads more like to run
line 22973-->    The country base than to commit such slaughter;
line 22974-->    With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
line 22975-->    Than those for preservation cas'd or shame-
line 22976-->    Made good the passage, cried to those that fled
line 22977-->    'Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men.
line 22978-->    To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards! Stand;
line 22979-->    Or we are Romans and will give you that,
line 22980-->    Like beasts, which you shun beastly, and may save
line 22981-->    But to look back in frown. Stand, stand!' These three,
line 22982-->    Three thousand confident, in act as many-
line 22983-->    For three performers are the file when all
line 22984-->    The rest do nothing- with this word 'Stand, stand!'
line 22985-->    Accommodated by the place, more charming
line 22986-->    With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd
line 22987-->    A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
line 22988-->    Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some turn'd coward
line 22989-->    But by example- O, a sin in war
line 22990-->    Damn'd in the first beginners!- gan to look
line 22991-->    The way that they did and to grin like lions
line 22992-->    Upon the pikes o' th' hunters. Then began
line 22993-->    A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
line 22994-->    A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
line 22995-->    Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
line 22996-->    The strides they victors made; and now our cowards,
line 22997-->    Like fragments in hard voyages, became
line 22998-->    The life o' th' need. Having found the back-door open
line 22999-->    Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
line 23000-->    Some slain before, some dying, some their friends
line 23001-->    O'erborne i' th' former wave. Ten chas'd by one
line 23002-->    Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty.
line 23003-->    Those that would die or ere resist are grown
line 23004-->    The mortal bugs o' th' field.
line 23005-->  LORD. This was strange chance:
line 23006-->    A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
line 23007-->  POSTHUMUS. Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made  
line 23008-->    Rather to wonder at the things you hear
line 23009-->    Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
line 23010-->    And vent it for a mock'ry? Here is one:
line 23011-->    'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
line 23012-->    Preserv'd the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'
line 23013-->  LORD. Nay, be not angry, sir.
line 23014-->  POSTHUMUS. 'Lack, to what end?
line 23015-->    Who dares not stand his foe I'll be his friend;
line 23016-->    For if he'll do as he is made to do,
line 23017-->    I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
line 23018-->    You have put me into rhyme.
line 23019-->  LORD. Farewell; you're angry.                             Exit
line 23020-->  POSTHUMUS. Still going? This is a lord! O noble misery,
line 23021-->    To be i' th' field and ask 'What news?' of me!
line 23022-->    To-day how many would have given their honours
line 23023-->    To have sav'd their carcasses! took heel to do't,
line 23024-->    And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
line 23025-->    Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
line 23026-->    Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,
line 23027-->    'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
line 23028-->    Sweet words; or hath moe ministers than we
line 23029-->    That draw his knives i' th' war. Well, I will find him;
line 23030-->    For being now a favourer to the Briton,
line 23031-->    No more a Briton, I have resum'd again
line 23032-->    The part I came in. Fight I will no more,
line 23033-->    But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
line 23034-->    Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
line 23035-->    Here made by th' Roman; great the answer be
line 23036-->    Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;
line 23037-->    On either side I come to spend my breath,
line 23038-->    Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
line 23039-->    But end it by some means for Imogen.
line 23040-->
line 23041-->            Enter two BRITISH CAPTAINS and soldiers
line 23042-->
line 23043-->  FIRST CAPTAIN. Great Jupiter be prais'd! Lucius is taken.
line 23044-->    'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
line 23045-->  SECOND CAPTAIN. There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
line 23046-->    That gave th' affront with them.
line 23047-->  FIRST CAPTAIN. So 'tis reported;  
line 23048-->    But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
line 23049-->  POSTHUMUS. A Roman,
line 23050-->    Who had not now been drooping here if seconds
line 23051-->    Had answer'd him.
line 23052-->  SECOND CAPTAIN. Lay hands on him; a dog!
line 23053-->    A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
line 23054-->    What crows have peck'd them here. He brags his service,
line 23055-->    As if he were of note. Bring him to th' King.
line 23056-->
line 23057-->   Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, and Roman
line 23058-->   captives. The CAPTAINS present POSTHUMUS to CYMBELINE, who delivers
line 23059-->            him over to a gaoler. Exeunt omnes

line 23064-->SCENE IV.
line 23065-->Britain. A prison
line 23066-->
line 23067-->Enter POSTHUMUS and two GAOLERS
line 23068-->
line 23069-->  FIRST GAOLER. You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;
line 23070-->    So graze as you find pasture.
line 23071-->  SECOND GAOLER. Ay, or a stomach.                Exeunt GAOLERS
line 23072-->  POSTHUMUS. Most welcome, bondage! for thou art a way,
line 23073-->    I think, to liberty. Yet am I better
line 23074-->    Than one that's sick o' th' gout, since he had rather
line 23075-->    Groan so in perpetuity than be cur'd
line 23076-->    By th' sure physician death, who is the key
line 23077-->    T' unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
line 23078-->    More than my shanks and wrists; you good gods, give me
line 23079-->    The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
line 23080-->    Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?
line 23081-->    So children temporal fathers do appease;
line 23082-->    Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,
line 23083-->    I cannot do it better than in gyves,
line 23084-->    Desir'd more than constrain'd. To satisfy,
line 23085-->    If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take  
line 23086-->    No stricter render of me than my all.
line 23087-->    I know you are more clement than vile men,
line 23088-->    Who of their broken debtors take a third,
line 23089-->    A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
line 23090-->    On their abatement; that's not my desire.
line 23091-->    For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
line 23092-->    'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
line 23093-->    'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
line 23094-->    Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake;
line 23095-->    You rather mine, being yours. And so, great pow'rs,
line 23096-->    If you will take this audit, take this life,
line 23097-->    And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
line 23098-->    I'll speak to thee in silence.                      [Sleeps]
line 23099-->
line 23100-->        Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS
line 23101-->        LEONATUS, father to POSTHUMUS, an old man attired
line 23102-->         like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient
line 23103-->          matron, his WIFE, and mother to POSTHUMUS, with
line 23104-->        music before them. Then, after other music, follows
line 23105-->           the two young LEONATI, brothers to POSTHUMUS,  
line 23106-->              with wounds, as they died in the wars.
line 23107-->          They circle POSTHUMUS round as he lies sleeping
line 23108-->
line 23109-->  SICILIUS. No more, thou thunder-master, show
line 23110-->              Thy spite on mortal flies.
line 23111-->            With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
line 23112-->              That thy adulteries
line 23113-->                Rates and revenges.
line 23114-->            Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
line 23115-->              Whose face I never saw?
line 23116-->            I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
line 23117-->              Attending nature's law;
line 23118-->            Whose father then, as men report
line 23119-->              Thou orphans' father art,
line 23120-->            Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
line 23121-->              From this earth-vexing smart.
line 23122-->
line 23123-->  MOTHER.   Lucina lent not me her aid,
line 23124-->              But took me in my throes,
line 23125-->            That from me was Posthumus ripp'd,  
line 23126-->              Came crying 'mongst his foes,
line 23127-->                A thing of pity.
line 23128-->
line 23129-->  SICILIUS. Great Nature like his ancestry
line 23130-->              Moulded the stuff so fair
line 23131-->            That he deserv'd the praise o' th' world
line 23132-->              As great Sicilius' heir.
line 23133-->
line 23134-->  FIRST BROTHER. When once he was mature for man,
line 23135-->              In Britain where was he
line 23136-->            That could stand up his parallel,
line 23137-->              Or fruitful object be
line 23138-->            In eye of Imogen, that best
line 23139-->              Could deem his dignity?
line 23140-->
line 23141-->  MOTHER.   With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
line 23142-->              To be exil'd and thrown
line 23143-->            From Leonati seat and cast
line 23144-->            From her his dearest one,
line 23145-->              Sweet Imogen?  
line 23146-->
line 23147-->  SICILIUS. Why did you suffer Iachimo,
line 23148-->              Slight thing of Italy,
line 23149-->            To taint his nobler heart and brain
line 23150-->              With needless jealousy,
line 23151-->            And to become the geck and scorn
line 23152-->              O' th' other's villainy?
line 23153-->
line 23154-->  SECOND BROTHER. For this from stiller seats we came,
line 23155-->              Our parents and us twain,
line 23156-->            That, striking in our country's cause,
line 23157-->              Fell bravely and were slain,
line 23158-->            Our fealty and Tenantius' right
line 23159-->              With honour to maintain.
line 23160-->
line 23161-->  FIRST BROTHER. Like hardiment Posthumus hath
line 23162-->              To Cymbeline perform'd.
line 23163-->            Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
line 23164-->              Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
line 23165-->            The graces for his merits due,  
line 23166-->              Being all to dolours turn'd?
line 23167-->
line 23168-->  SICILIUS. Thy crystal window ope; look out;
line 23169-->              No longer exercise
line 23170-->            Upon a valiant race thy harsh
line 23171-->              And potent injuries.
line 23172-->
line 23173-->  MOTHER.   Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
line 23174-->              Take off his miseries.
line 23175-->
line 23176-->  SICILIUS. Peep through thy marble mansion. Help!
line 23177-->              Or we poor ghosts will cry
line 23178-->            To th' shining synod of the rest
line 23179-->              Against thy deity.
line 23180-->
line 23181-->  BROTHERS. Help, Jupiter! or we appeal,
line 23182-->              And from thy justice fly.
line 23183-->
line 23184-->       JUPITER descends-in thunder and lightning, sitting
line 23185-->       upon an eagle. He throws a thunderbolt. The GHOSTS  
line 23186-->                     fall on their knees
line 23187-->
line 23188-->  JUPITER. No more, you petty spirits of region low,
line 23189-->    Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
line 23190-->    Accuse the Thunderer whose bolt, you know,
line 23191-->    Sky-planted, batters all rebelling coasts?
line 23192-->    Poor shadows of Elysium, hence and rest
line 23193-->    Upon your never-withering banks of flow'rs.
line 23194-->    Be not with mortal accidents opprest:
line 23195-->    No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
line 23196-->    Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
line 23197-->    The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;
line 23198-->    Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift;
line 23199-->    His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
line 23200-->    Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
line 23201-->    Our temple was he married. Rise and fade!
line 23202-->    He shall be lord of Lady Imogen,
line 23203-->    And happier much by his affliction made.
line 23204-->    This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
line 23205-->    Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine;  
line 23206-->    And so, away; no farther with your din
line 23207-->    Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
line 23208-->    Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.            [Ascends]
line 23209-->  SICILIUS. He came in thunder; his celestial breath
line 23210-->    Was sulpherous to smell; the holy eagle
line 23211-->    Stoop'd as to foot us. His ascension is
line 23212-->    More sweet than our blest fields. His royal bird
line 23213-->    Prunes the immortal wing, and cloys his beak,
line 23214-->    As when his god is pleas'd.
line 23215-->  ALL. Thanks, Jupiter!
line 23216-->  SICILIUS. The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
line 23217-->    His radiant roof. Away! and, to be blest,
line 23218-->    Let us with care perform his great behest.   [GHOSTS vanish]
line 23219-->
line 23220-->  POSTHUMUS. [Waking] Sleep, thou has been a grandsire and begot
line 23221-->    A father to me; and thou hast created
line 23222-->    A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
line 23223-->    Gone! They went hence so soon as they were born.
line 23224-->    And so I am awake. Poor wretches, that depend
line 23225-->    On greatness' favour, dream as I have done;  
line 23226-->    Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve;
line 23227-->    Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
line 23228-->    And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,
line 23229-->    That have this golden chance, and know not why.
line 23230-->    What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
line 23231-->    Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
line 23232-->    Nobler than that it covers. Let thy effects
line 23233-->    So follow to be most unlike our courtiers,
line 23234-->    As good as promise.
line 23235-->
line 23236-->    [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,
line 23237-->    without seeking find, and be embrac'd by a piece of tender air;
line 23238-->    and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches which,
line 23239-->    being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
line 23240-->    stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,
line 23241-->    Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'
line 23242-->
line 23243-->    'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
line 23244-->    Tongue, and brain not; either both or nothing,
line 23245-->    Or senseless speaking, or a speaking such  
line 23246-->    As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
line 23247-->    The action of my life is like it, which
line 23248-->    I'll keep, if but for sympathy.
line 23249-->
line 23250-->                  Re-enter GAOLER
line 23251-->
line 23252-->  GAOLER. Come, sir, are you ready for death?
line 23253-->  POSTHUMUS. Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
line 23254-->  GAOLER. Hanging is the word, sir; if you be ready for that, you are
line 23255-->    well cook'd.
line 23256-->  POSTHUMUS. So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish
line 23257-->    pays the shot.
line 23258-->  GAOLER. A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you
line 23259-->    shall be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern bills,
line 23260-->    which are often the sadness of parting, as the procuring of mirth.
line 23261-->    You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much
line 23262-->    drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and sorry that you are
line 23263-->    paid too much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the heavier
line 23264-->    for being too light, the purse too light, being drawn of
line 23265-->    heaviness. O, of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the  
line 23266-->    charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You
line 23267-->    have no true debitor and creditor but it; of what's past, is, and
line 23268-->    to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and
line 23269-->    counters; so the acquittance follows.
line 23270-->  POSTHUMUS. I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
line 23271-->  GAOLER. Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache. But a
line 23272-->    man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to
line 23273-->    bed, I think he would change places with his officer; for look
line 23274-->    you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.
line 23275-->  POSTHUMUS. Yes indeed do I, fellow.
line 23276-->  GAOLER. Your death has eyes in's head, then; I have not seen him so
line 23277-->    pictur'd. You must either be directed by some that take upon them
line 23278-->    to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not
line 23279-->    know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril. And how you
line 23280-->    shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll never return to
line 23281-->    tell one.
line 23282-->  POSTHUMUS. I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct
line 23283-->    them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.
line 23284-->  GAOLER. What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the
line 23285-->    best use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure hanging's  
line 23286-->    the way of winking.
line 23287-->
line 23288-->                        Enter a MESSENGER
line 23289-->
line 23290-->  MESSENGER. Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the King.
line 23291-->  POSTHUMUS. Thou bring'st good news: I am call'd to be made free.
line 23292-->  GAOLER. I'll be hang'd then.
line 23293-->  POSTHUMUS. Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the
line 23294-->    dead.                         Exeunt POSTHUMUS and MESSENGER
line 23295-->  GAOLER. Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets,
line 23296-->    I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my conscience, there are verier
line 23297-->    knaves desire to live, for all he be a Roman; and there be some
line 23298-->    of them too that die against their wills; so should I, if I were
line 23299-->    one. I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good. O, there
line 23300-->    were desolation of gaolers and gallowses! I speak against my
line 23301-->    present profit, but my wish hath a preferment in't.     Exit
line 23302-->
line 23303-->
line 23304-->
line 23305-->
line 23306-->SCENE V.
line 23307-->Britain. CYMBELINE'S tent
line 23308-->
line 23309-->Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, LORDS,
line 23310-->OFFICERS, and attendants
line 23311-->
line 23312-->  CYMBELINE. Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
line 23313-->    Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
line 23314-->    That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
line 23315-->    Whose rags sham'd gilded arms, whose naked breast
line 23316-->    Stepp'd before targes of proof, cannot be found.
line 23317-->    He shall be happy that can find him, if
line 23318-->    Our grace can make him so.
line 23319-->  BELARIUS. I never saw
line 23320-->    Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
line 23321-->    Such precious deeds in one that promis'd nought
line 23322-->    But beggary and poor looks.
line 23323-->  CYMBELINE. No tidings of him?
line 23324-->  PISANIO. He hath been search'd among the dead and living,
line 23325-->    But no trace of him.
line 23326-->  CYMBELINE. To my grief, I am
line 23327-->    The heir of his reward; [To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]  
line 23328-->      which I will add
line 23329-->    To you, the liver, heart, and brain, of Britain,
line 23330-->    By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
line 23331-->    To ask of whence you are. Report it.
line 23332-->  BELARIUS. Sir,
line 23333-->    In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen;
line 23334-->    Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
line 23335-->    Unless I add we are honest.
line 23336-->  CYMBELINE. Bow your knees.
line 23337-->    Arise my knights o' th' battle; I create you
line 23338-->    Companions to our person, and will fit you
line 23339-->    With dignities becoming your estates.
line 23340-->
line 23341-->             Enter CORNELIUS and LADIES
line 23342-->
line 23343-->    There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
line 23344-->    Greet you our victory? You look like Romans,
line 23345-->    And not o' th' court of Britain.
line 23346-->  CORNELIUS. Hail, great King!
line 23347-->    To sour your happiness I must report  
line 23348-->    The Queen is dead.
line 23349-->  CYMBELINE. Who worse than a physician
line 23350-->    Would this report become? But I consider
line 23351-->    By med'cine'life may be prolong'd, yet death
line 23352-->    Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
line 23353-->  CORNELIUS. With horror, madly dying, like her life;
line 23354-->    Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
line 23355-->    Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
line 23356-->    I will report, so please you; these her women
line 23357-->    Can trip me if I err, who with wet cheeks
line 23358-->    Were present when she finish'd.
line 23359-->  CYMBELINE. Prithee say.
line 23360-->  CORNELIUS. First, she confess'd she never lov'd you; only
line 23361-->    Affected greatness got by you, not you;
line 23362-->    Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
line 23363-->    Abhorr'd your person.
line 23364-->  CYMBELINE. She alone knew this;
line 23365-->    And but she spoke it dying, I would not
line 23366-->    Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
line 23367-->  CORNELIUS. Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love  
line 23368-->    With such integrity, she did confess
line 23369-->    Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
line 23370-->    But that her flight prevented it, she had
line 23371-->    Ta'en off by poison.
line 23372-->  CYMBELINE. O most delicate fiend!
line 23373-->    Who is't can read a woman? Is there more?
line 23374-->  CORNELIUS. More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
line 23375-->    For you a mortal mineral, which, being took,
line 23376-->    Should by the minute feed on life, and ling'ring,
line 23377-->    By inches waste you. In which time she purpos'd,
line 23378-->    By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
line 23379-->    O'ercome you with her show; and in time,
line 23380-->    When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
line 23381-->    Her son into th' adoption of the crown;
line 23382-->    But failing of her end by his strange absence,
line 23383-->    Grew shameless-desperate, open'd, in despite
line 23384-->    Of heaven and men, her purposes, repented
line 23385-->    The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so,
line 23386-->    Despairing, died.
line 23387-->  CYMBELINE. Heard you all this, her women?  
line 23388-->  LADY. We did, so please your Highness.
line 23389-->  CYMBELINE. Mine eyes
line 23390-->    Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
line 23391-->    Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart
line 23392-->    That thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious
line 23393-->    To have mistrusted her; yet, O my daughter!
line 23394-->    That it was folly in me thou mayst say,
line 23395-->    And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
line 23396-->
line 23397-->         Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the SOOTHSAYER, and other
line 23398-->      Roman prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS behind, and IMOGEN
line 23399-->
line 23400-->    Thou com'st not, Caius, now for tribute; that
line 23401-->    The Britons have raz'd out, though with the loss
line 23402-->    Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit
line 23403-->    That their good souls may be appeas'd with slaughter
line 23404-->    Of you their captives, which ourself have granted;
line 23405-->    So think of your estate.
line 23406-->  LUCIUS. Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day
line 23407-->    Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,  
line 23408-->    We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten'd
line 23409-->    Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
line 23410-->    Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
line 23411-->    May be call'd ransom, let it come. Sufficeth
line 23412-->    A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
line 23413-->    Augustus lives to think on't; and so much
line 23414-->    For my peculiar care. This one thing only
line 23415-->    I will entreat: my boy, a Briton born,
line 23416-->    Let him be ransom'd. Never master had
line 23417-->    A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
line 23418-->    So tender over his occasions, true,
line 23419-->    So feat, so nurse-like; let his virtue join
line 23420-->    With my request, which I'll make bold your Highness
line 23421-->    Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm
line 23422-->    Though he have serv'd a Roman. Save him, sir,
line 23423-->    And spare no blood beside.
line 23424-->  CYMBELINE. I have surely seen him;
line 23425-->    His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
line 23426-->    Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
line 23427-->    And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore  
line 23428-->    To say 'Live, boy.' Ne'er thank thy master. Live;
line 23429-->    And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
line 23430-->    Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;
line 23431-->    Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
line 23432-->    The noblest ta'en.
line 23433-->  IMOGEN. I humbly thank your Highness.
line 23434-->  LUCIUS. I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
line 23435-->    And yet I know thou wilt.
line 23436-->  IMOGEN. No, no! Alack,
line 23437-->    There's other work in hand. I see a thing
line 23438-->    Bitter to me as death; your life, good master,
line 23439-->    Must shuffle for itself.
line 23440-->  LUCIUS. The boy disdains me,
line 23441-->    He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys
line 23442-->    That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
line 23443-->    Why stands he so perplex'd?
line 23444-->  CYMBELINE. What wouldst thou, boy?
line 23445-->    I love thee more and more; think more and more
line 23446-->    What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? Speak,
line 23447-->    Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?  
line 23448-->  IMOGEN. He is a Roman, no more kin to me
line 23449-->    Than I to your Highness; who, being born your vassal,
line 23450-->    Am something nearer.
line 23451-->  CYMBELINE. Wherefore ey'st him so?
line 23452-->  IMOGEN. I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
line 23453-->    To give me hearing.
line 23454-->  CYMBELINE. Ay, with all my heart,
line 23455-->    And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
line 23456-->  IMOGEN. Fidele, sir.
line 23457-->  CYMBELINE. Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
line 23458-->    I'll be thy master. Walk with me; speak freely.
line 23459-->                           [CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart]
line 23460-->  BELARIUS. Is not this boy reviv'd from death?
line 23461-->  ARVIRAGUS. One sand another
line 23462-->    Not more resembles- that sweet rosy lad
line 23463-->    Who died and was Fidele. What think you?
line 23464-->  GUIDERIUS. The same dead thing alive.
line 23465-->  BELARIUS. Peace, peace! see further. He eyes us not; forbear.
line 23466-->    Creatures may be alike; were't he, I am sure
line 23467-->    He would have spoke to us.  
line 23468-->  GUIDERIUS. But we saw him dead.
line 23469-->  BELARIUS. Be silent; let's see further.
line 23470-->  PISANIO. [Aside] It is my mistress.
line 23471-->    Since she is living, let the time run on
line 23472-->    To good or bad.               [CYMBELINE and IMOGEN advance]
line 23473-->  CYMBELINE. Come, stand thou by our side;
line 23474-->    Make thy demand aloud. [To IACHIMO] Sir, step you forth;
line 23475-->    Give answer to this boy, and do it freely,
line 23476-->    Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
line 23477-->    Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
line 23478-->    Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.
line 23479-->  IMOGEN. My boon is that this gentleman may render
line 23480-->    Of whom he had this ring.
line 23481-->  POSTHUMUS. [Aside] What's that to him?
line 23482-->  CYMBELINE. That diamond upon your finger, say
line 23483-->    How came it yours?
line 23484-->  IACHIMO. Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
line 23485-->    Which to be spoke would torture thee.
line 23486-->  CYMBELINE. How? me?
line 23487-->  IACHIMO. I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that  
line 23488-->    Which torments me to conceal. By villainy
line 23489-->    I got this ring; 'twas Leonatus' jewel,
line 23490-->    Whom thou didst banish; and- which more may grieve thee,
line 23491-->    As it doth me- a nobler sir ne'er liv'd
line 23492-->    'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
line 23493-->  CYMBELINE. All that belongs to this.
line 23494-->  IACHIMO. That paragon, thy daughter,
line 23495-->    For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
line 23496-->    Quail to remember- Give me leave, I faint.
line 23497-->  CYMBELINE. My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength;
line 23498-->    I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
line 23499-->    Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.
line 23500-->  IACHIMO. Upon a time- unhappy was the clock
line 23501-->    That struck the hour!- was in Rome- accurs'd
line 23502-->    The mansion where!- 'twas at a feast- O, would
line 23503-->    Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
line 23504-->    Those which I heav'd to head!- the good Posthumus-
line 23505-->    What should I say? he was too good to be
line 23506-->    Where ill men were, and was the best of all
line 23507-->    Amongst the rar'st of good ones- sitting sadly  
line 23508-->    Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
line 23509-->    For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
line 23510-->    Of him that best could speak; for feature, laming
line 23511-->    The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,
line 23512-->    Postures beyond brief nature; for condition,
line 23513-->    A shop of all the qualities that man
line 23514-->    Loves woman for; besides that hook of wiving,
line 23515-->    Fairness which strikes the eye-
line 23516-->  CYMBELINE. I stand on fire.
line 23517-->    Come to the matter.
line 23518-->  IACHIMO. All too soon I shall,
line 23519-->    Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
line 23520-->    Most like a noble lord in love and one
line 23521-->    That had a royal lover, took his hint;
line 23522-->    And not dispraising whom we prais'd- therein
line 23523-->    He was as calm as virtue- he began
line 23524-->    His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made,
line 23525-->    And then a mind put in't, either our brags
line 23526-->    Were crack'd of kitchen trulls, or his description
line 23527-->    Prov'd us unspeaking sots.  
line 23528-->  CYMBELINE. Nay, nay, to th' purpose.
line 23529-->  IACHIMO. Your daughter's chastity- there it begins.
line 23530-->    He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams
line 23531-->    And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,
line 23532-->    Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him
line 23533-->    Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
line 23534-->    Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
line 23535-->    In suit the place of's bed, and win this ring
line 23536-->    By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
line 23537-->    No lesser of her honour confident
line 23538-->    Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
line 23539-->    And would so, had it been a carbuncle
line 23540-->    Of Phoebus' wheel; and might so safely, had it
line 23541-->    Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
line 23542-->    Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,
line 23543-->    Remember me at court, where I was taught
line 23544-->    Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
line 23545-->    'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
line 23546-->    Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
line 23547-->    Gan in your duller Britain operate  
line 23548-->    Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent;
line 23549-->    And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd
line 23550-->    That I return'd with simular proof enough
line 23551-->    To make the noble Leonatus mad,
line 23552-->    By wounding his belief in her renown
line 23553-->    With tokens thus and thus; averring notes
line 23554-->    Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet-
line 23555-->    O cunning, how I got it!- nay, some marks
line 23556-->    Of secret on her person, that he could not
line 23557-->    But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
line 23558-->    I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon-
line 23559-->    Methinks I see him now-
line 23560-->  POSTHUMUS. [Coming forward] Ay, so thou dost,
line 23561-->    Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
line 23562-->    Egregious murderer, thief, anything
line 23563-->    That's due to all the villains past, in being,
line 23564-->    To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
line 23565-->    Some upright justicer! Thou, King, send out
line 23566-->    For torturers ingenious. It is I
line 23567-->    That all th' abhorred things o' th' earth amend  
line 23568-->    By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
line 23569-->    That kill'd thy daughter; villain-like, I lie-
line 23570-->    That caus'd a lesser villain than myself,
line 23571-->    A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
line 23572-->    Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
line 23573-->    Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
line 23574-->    The dogs o' th' street to bay me. Every villain
line 23575-->    Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus, and
line 23576-->    Be villainy less than 'twas! O Imogen!
line 23577-->    My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
line 23578-->    Imogen, Imogen!
line 23579-->  IMOGEN. Peace, my lord. Hear, hear!
line 23580-->  POSTHUMUS. Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
line 23581-->    There lies thy part.                [Strikes her. She falls]
line 23582-->  PISANIO. O gentlemen, help!
line 23583-->    Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!
line 23584-->    You ne'er kill'd Imogen till now. Help, help!
line 23585-->    Mine honour'd lady!
line 23586-->  CYMBELINE. Does the world go round?
line 23587-->  POSTHUMUS. How comes these staggers on me?  
line 23588-->  PISANIO. Wake, my mistress!
line 23589-->  CYMBELINE. If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
line 23590-->    To death with mortal joy.
line 23591-->  PISANIO. How fares my mistress?
line 23592-->  IMOGEN. O, get thee from my sight;
line 23593-->    Thou gav'st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence!
line 23594-->    Breathe not where princes are.
line 23595-->  CYMBELINE. The tune of Imogen!
line 23596-->  PISANIO. Lady,
line 23597-->    The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
line 23598-->    That box I gave you was not thought by me
line 23599-->    A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
line 23600-->  CYMBELINE. New matter still?
line 23601-->  IMOGEN. It poison'd me.
line 23602-->  CORNELIUS. O gods!
line 23603-->    I left out one thing which the Queen confess'd,
line 23604-->    Which must approve thee honest. 'If Pisanio
line 23605-->    Have' said she 'given his mistress that confection
line 23606-->    Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv'd
line 23607-->    As I would serve a rat.'  
line 23608-->  CYMBELINE. What's this, Cornelius?
line 23609-->  CORNELIUS. The Queen, sir, very oft importun'd me
line 23610-->    To temper poisons for her; still pretending
line 23611-->    The satisfaction of her knowledge only
line 23612-->    In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
line 23613-->    Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose
line 23614-->    Was of more danger, did compound for her
line 23615-->    A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
line 23616-->    The present pow'r of life, but in short time
line 23617-->    All offices of nature should again
line 23618-->    Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
line 23619-->  IMOGEN. Most like I did, for I was dead.
line 23620-->  BELARIUS. My boys,
line 23621-->    There was our error.
line 23622-->  GUIDERIUS. This is sure Fidele.
line 23623-->  IMOGEN. Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
line 23624-->    Think that you are upon a rock, and now
line 23625-->    Throw me again.                              [Embracing him]
line 23626-->  POSTHUMUS. Hang there like fruit, my soul,
line 23627-->    Till the tree die!  
line 23628-->  CYMBELINE. How now, my flesh? my child?
line 23629-->    What, mak'st thou me a dullard in this act?
line 23630-->    Wilt thou not speak to me?
line 23631-->  IMOGEN. [Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.
line 23632-->  BELARIUS. [To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love this
line 23633-->      youth, I blame ye not;
line 23634-->    You had a motive for't.
line 23635-->  CYMBELINE. My tears that fall
line 23636-->    Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
line 23637-->    Thy mother's dead.
line 23638-->  IMOGEN. I am sorry for't, my lord.
line 23639-->  CYMBELINE. O, she was naught, and long of her it was
line 23640-->    That we meet here so strangely; but her son
line 23641-->    Is gone, we know not how nor where.
line 23642-->  PISANIO. My lord,
line 23643-->    Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
line 23644-->    Upon my lady's missing, came to me
line 23645-->    With his sword drawn, foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
line 23646-->    If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
line 23647-->    It was my instant death. By accident  
line 23648-->    I had a feigned letter of my master's
line 23649-->    Then in my pocket, which directed him
line 23650-->    To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
line 23651-->    Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
line 23652-->    Which he enforc'd from me, away he posts
line 23653-->    With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate
line 23654-->    My lady's honour. What became of him
line 23655-->    I further know not.
line 23656-->  GUIDERIUS. Let me end the story:
line 23657-->    I slew him there.
line 23658-->  CYMBELINE. Marry, the gods forfend!
line 23659-->    I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
line 23660-->    Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,
line 23661-->    Deny't again.
line 23662-->  GUIDERIUS. I have spoke it, and I did it.
line 23663-->  CYMBELINE. He was a prince.
line 23664-->  GUIDERIUS. A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
line 23665-->    Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
line 23666-->    With language that would make me spurn the sea,
line 23667-->    If it could so roar to me. I cut off's head,  
line 23668-->    And am right glad he is not standing here
line 23669-->    To tell this tale of mine.
line 23670-->  CYMBELINE. I am sorry for thee.
line 23671-->    By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
line 23672-->    Endure our law. Thou'rt dead.
line 23673-->  IMOGEN. That headless man
line 23674-->    I thought had been my lord.
line 23675-->  CYMBELINE. Bind the offender,
line 23676-->    And take him from our presence.
line 23677-->  BELARIUS. Stay, sir King.
line 23678-->    This man is better than the man he slew,
line 23679-->    As well descended as thyself, and hath
line 23680-->    More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
line 23681-->    Had ever scar for. [To the guard] Let his arms alone;
line 23682-->    They were not born for bondage.
line 23683-->  CYMBELINE. Why, old soldier,
line 23684-->    Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
line 23685-->    By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
line 23686-->    As good as we?
line 23687-->  ARVIRAGUS. In that he spake too far.  
line 23688-->  CYMBELINE. And thou shalt die for't.
line 23689-->  BELARIUS. We will die all three;
line 23690-->    But I will prove that two on's are as good
line 23691-->    As I have given out him. My sons, I must
line 23692-->    For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,
line 23693-->    Though haply well for you.
line 23694-->  ARVIRAGUS. Your danger's ours.
line 23695-->  GUIDERIUS. And our good his.
line 23696-->  BELARIUS. Have at it then by leave!
line 23697-->    Thou hadst, great King, a subject who
line 23698-->    Was call'd Belarius.
line 23699-->  CYMBELINE. What of him? He is
line 23700-->    A banish'd traitor.
line 23701-->  BELARIUS. He it is that hath
line 23702-->    Assum'd this age; indeed a banish'd man;
line 23703-->    I know not how a traitor.
line 23704-->  CYMBELINE. Take him hence,
line 23705-->    The whole world shall not save him.
line 23706-->  BELARIUS. Not too hot.
line 23707-->    First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,  
line 23708-->    And let it be confiscate all, so soon
line 23709-->    As I have receiv'd it.
line 23710-->  CYMBELINE. Nursing of my sons?
line 23711-->  BELARIUS. I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee.
line 23712-->    Ere I arise I will prefer my sons;
line 23713-->    Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
line 23714-->    These two young gentlemen that call me father,
line 23715-->    And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
line 23716-->    They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
line 23717-->    And blood of your begetting.
line 23718-->  CYMBELINE. How? my issue?
line 23719-->  BELARIUS. So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
line 23720-->    Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd.
line 23721-->    Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
line 23722-->    Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
line 23723-->    Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes-
line 23724-->    For such and so they are- these twenty years
line 23725-->    Have I train'd up; those arts they have as
line 23726-->    Could put into them. My breeding was, sir, as
line 23727-->    Your Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,  
line 23728-->    Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
line 23729-->    Upon my banishment; I mov'd her to't,
line 23730-->    Having receiv'd the punishment before
line 23731-->    For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty
line 23732-->    Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,
line 23733-->    The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shap'd
line 23734-->    Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
line 23735-->    Here are your sons again, and I must lose
line 23736-->    Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
line 23737-->    The benediction of these covering heavens
line 23738-->    Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
line 23739-->    To inlay heaven with stars.
line 23740-->  CYMBELINE. Thou weep'st and speak'st.
line 23741-->    The service that you three have done is more
line 23742-->    Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children.
line 23743-->    If these be they, I know not how to wish
line 23744-->    A pair of worthier sons.
line 23745-->  BELARIUS. Be pleas'd awhile.
line 23746-->    This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
line 23747-->    Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;  
line 23748-->    This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
line 23749-->    Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
line 23750-->    In a most curious mantle, wrought by th' hand
line 23751-->    Of his queen mother, which for more probation
line 23752-->    I can with ease produce.
line 23753-->  CYMBELINE. Guiderius had
line 23754-->    Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
line 23755-->    It was a mark of wonder.
line 23756-->  BELARIUS. This is he,
line 23757-->    Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.
line 23758-->    It was wise nature's end in the donation,
line 23759-->    To be his evidence now.
line 23760-->  CYMBELINE. O, what am I?
line 23761-->    A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
line 23762-->    Rejoic'd deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
line 23763-->    That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
line 23764-->    You may reign in them now! O Imogen,
line 23765-->    Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.
line 23766-->  IMOGEN. No, my lord;
line 23767-->    I have got two worlds by't. O my gentle brothers,  
line 23768-->    Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
line 23769-->    But I am truest speaker! You call'd me brother,
line 23770-->    When I was but your sister: I you brothers,
line 23771-->    When we were so indeed.
line 23772-->  CYMBELINE. Did you e'er meet?
line 23773-->  ARVIRAGUS. Ay, my good lord.
line 23774-->  GUIDERIUS. And at first meeting lov'd,
line 23775-->    Continu'd so until we thought he died.
line 23776-->  CORNELIUS. By the Queen's dram she swallow'd.
line 23777-->  CYMBELINE. O rare instinct!
line 23778-->    When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgment
line 23779-->    Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
line 23780-->    Distinction should be rich in. Where? how liv'd you?
line 23781-->    And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
line 23782-->    How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
line 23783-->    Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
line 23784-->    And your three motives to the battle, with
line 23785-->    I know not how much more, should be demanded,
line 23786-->    And all the other by-dependences,
line 23787-->    From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place  
line 23788-->    Will serve our long interrogatories. See,
line 23789-->    Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;
line 23790-->    And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
line 23791-->    On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting
line 23792-->    Each object with a joy; the counterchange
line 23793-->    Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
line 23794-->    And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
line 23795-->    [To BELARIUS] Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.
line 23796-->  IMOGEN. You are my father too, and did relieve me
line 23797-->    To see this gracious season.
line 23798-->  CYMBELINE. All o'erjoy'd
line 23799-->    Save these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,
line 23800-->    For they shall taste our comfort.
line 23801-->  IMOGEN. My good master,
line 23802-->    I will yet do you service.
line 23803-->  LUCIUS. Happy be you!
line 23804-->  CYMBELINE. The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
line 23805-->    He would have well becom'd this place and grac'd
line 23806-->    The thankings of a king.
line 23807-->  POSTHUMUS. I am, sir,  
line 23808-->    The soldier that did company these three
line 23809-->    In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
line 23810-->    The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
line 23811-->    Speak, Iachimo. I had you down, and might
line 23812-->    Have made you finish.
line 23813-->  IACHIMO. [Kneeling] I am down again;
line 23814-->    But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
line 23815-->    As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
line 23816-->    Which I so often owe; but your ring first,
line 23817-->    And here the bracelet of the truest princess
line 23818-->    That ever swore her faith.
line 23819-->  POSTHUMUS. Kneel not to me.
line 23820-->    The pow'r that I have on you is to spare you;
line 23821-->    The malice towards you to forgive you. Live,
line 23822-->    And deal with others better.
line 23823-->  CYMBELINE. Nobly doom'd!
line 23824-->    We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
line 23825-->    Pardon's the word to all.
line 23826-->  ARVIRAGUS. You holp us, sir,
line 23827-->    As you did mean indeed to be our brother;  
line 23828-->    Joy'd are we that you are.
line 23829-->  POSTHUMUS. Your servant, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,
line 23830-->    Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought
line 23831-->    Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
line 23832-->    Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
line 23833-->    Of mine own kindred. When I wak'd, I found
line 23834-->    This label on my bosom; whose containing
line 23835-->    Is so from sense in hardness that I can
line 23836-->    Make no collection of it. Let him show
line 23837-->    His skill in the construction.
line 23838-->  LUCIUS. Philarmonus!
line 23839-->  SOOTHSAYER. Here, my good lord.
line 23840-->  LUCIUS. Read, and declare the meaning.
line 23841-->  SOOTHSAYER. [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself
line 23842-->    unknown, without seeking find, and be embrac'd by
line 23843-->    a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall
line 23844-->    be lopp'd branches which, being dead many years, shall
line 23845-->    after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow;
line 23846-->    then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate
line 23847-->    and flourish in peace and plenty.'  
line 23848-->    Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
line 23849-->    The fit and apt construction of thy name,
line 23850-->    Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.
line 23851-->    [To CYMBELINE] The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
line 23852-->    Which we call 'mollis aer,' and 'mollis aer'
line 23853-->    We term it 'mulier'; which 'mulier' I divine
line 23854-->    Is this most constant wife, who even now
line 23855-->    Answering the letter of the oracle,
line 23856-->    Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
line 23857-->    With this most tender air.
line 23858-->  CYMBELINE. This hath some seeming.
line 23859-->  SOOTHSAYER. The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
line 23860-->    Personates thee; and thy lopp'd branches point
line 23861-->    Thy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol'n,
line 23862-->    For many years thought dead, are now reviv'd,
line 23863-->    To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
line 23864-->    Promises Britain peace and plenty.
line 23865-->  CYMBELINE. Well,
line 23866-->    My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
line 23867-->    Although the victor, we submit to Caesar  
line 23868-->    And to the Roman empire, promising
line 23869-->    To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
line 23870-->    We were dissuaded by our wicked queen,
line 23871-->    Whom heavens in justice, both on her and hers,
line 23872-->    Have laid most heavy hand.
line 23873-->  SOOTHSAYER. The fingers of the pow'rs above do tune
line 23874-->    The harmony of this peace. The vision
line 23875-->    Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
line 23876-->    Of yet this scarce-cold battle, at this instant
line 23877-->    Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
line 23878-->    From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
line 23879-->    Lessen'd herself and in the beams o' th' sun
line 23880-->    So vanish'd; which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
line 23881-->    Th'imperial Caesar, Caesar, should again unite
line 23882-->    His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
line 23883-->    Which shines here in the west.
line 23884-->  CYMBELINE. Laud we the gods;
line 23885-->    And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
line 23886-->    From our bless'd altars. Publish we this peace
line 23887-->    To all our subjects. Set we forward; let  
line 23888-->    A Roman and a British ensign wave
line 23889-->    Friendly together. So through Lud's Town march;
line 23890-->    And in the temple of great Jupiter
line 23891-->    Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
line 23892-->    Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
line 23893-->    Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.      Exeunt
line 23894-->
line 23895-->THE END

line 23967-->
line 23968-->SCENE.- Elsinore.
line 23969-->
line 23970-->
line 23971-->ACT I. Scene I.
line 23972-->Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
line 23973-->
line 23974-->Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
line 23975-->at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].
line 23976-->
line 23977-->  Ber. Who's there.?
line 23978-->  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
line 23979-->  Ber. Long live the King!
line 23980-->  Fran. Bernardo?
line 23981-->  Ber. He.
line 23982-->  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
line 23983-->  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
line 23984-->  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
line 23985-->    And I am sick at heart.
line 23986-->  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
line 23987-->  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
line 23988-->  Ber. Well, good night.
line 23989-->    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
line 23990-->    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
line 23991-->
line 23992-->                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  
line 23993-->
line 23994-->  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
line 23995-->  Hor. Friends to this ground.
line 23996-->  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
line 23997-->  Fran. Give you good night.
line 23998-->  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
line 23999-->    Who hath reliev'd you?
line 24000-->  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
line 24001-->    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
line 24002-->  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
line 24003-->  Ber. Say-
line 24004-->    What, is Horatio there ?
line 24005-->  Hor. A piece of him.
line 24006-->  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
line 24007-->  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
line 24008-->  Ber. I have seen nothing.
line 24009-->  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
line 24010-->    And will not let belief take hold of him
line 24011-->    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
line 24012-->    Therefore I have entreated him along,  
line 24013-->    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
line 24014-->    That, if again this apparition come,
line 24015-->    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
line 24016-->  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
line 24017-->  Ber. Sit down awhile,
line 24018-->    And let us once again assail your ears,
line 24019-->    That are so fortified against our story,
line 24020-->    What we two nights have seen.
line 24021-->  Hor. Well, sit we down,
line 24022-->    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
line 24023-->  Ber. Last night of all,
line 24024-->    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
line 24025-->    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
line 24026-->    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
line 24027-->    The bell then beating one-
line 24028-->
line 24029-->                        Enter Ghost.
line 24030-->
line 24031-->  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
line 24032-->  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
line 24033-->  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
line 24034-->  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
line 24035-->  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
line 24036-->  Ber. It would be spoke to.
line 24037-->  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
line 24038-->  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
line 24039-->    Together with that fair and warlike form
line 24040-->    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
line 24041-->    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
line 24042-->  Mar. It is offended.
line 24043-->  Ber. See, it stalks away!
line 24044-->  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
line 24045-->                                                     Exit Ghost.
line 24046-->  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
line 24047-->  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
line 24048-->    Is not this something more than fantasy?
line 24049-->    What think you on't?
line 24050-->  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
line 24051-->    Without the sensible and true avouch
line 24052-->    Of mine own eyes.  
line 24053-->  Mar. Is it not like the King?
line 24054-->  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
line 24055-->    Such was the very armour he had on
line 24056-->    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
line 24057-->    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
line 24058-->    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
line 24059-->    'Tis strange.
line 24060-->  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
line 24061-->    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
line 24062-->  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
line 24063-->    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
line 24064-->    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
line 24065-->  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
line 24066-->    Why this same strict and most observant watch
line 24067-->    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
line 24068-->    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
line 24069-->    And foreign mart for implements of war;
line 24070-->    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
line 24071-->    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
line 24072-->    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
line 24073-->    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
line 24074-->    Who is't that can inform me?
line 24075-->  Hor. That can I.
line 24076-->    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
line 24077-->    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
line 24078-->    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
line 24079-->    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
line 24080-->    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
line 24081-->    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
line 24082-->    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
line 24083-->    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
line 24084-->    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
line 24085-->    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
line 24086-->    Against the which a moiety competent
line 24087-->    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
line 24088-->    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
line 24089-->    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
line 24090-->    And carriage of the article design'd,
line 24091-->    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
line 24092-->    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
line 24093-->    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
line 24094-->    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
line 24095-->    For food and diet, to some enterprise
line 24096-->    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
line 24097-->    As it doth well appear unto our state,
line 24098-->    But to recover of us, by strong hand
line 24099-->    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
line 24100-->    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
line 24101-->    Is the main motive of our preparations,
line 24102-->    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
line 24103-->    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
line 24104-->  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
line 24105-->    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
line 24106-->    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
line 24107-->    That was and is the question of these wars.
line 24108-->  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
line 24109-->    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
line 24110-->    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
line 24111-->    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
line 24112-->    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
line 24113-->    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
line 24114-->    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
line 24115-->    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
line 24116-->    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
line 24117-->    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
line 24118-->    As harbingers preceding still the fates
line 24119-->    And prologue to the omen coming on,
line 24120-->    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
line 24121-->    Unto our climature and countrymen.
line 24122-->
line 24123-->                      Enter Ghost again.
line 24124-->
line 24125-->    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
line 24126-->    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
line 24127-->                                               Spreads his arms.
line 24128-->    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
line 24129-->    Speak to me.
line 24130-->    If there be any good thing to be done,
line 24131-->    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
line 24132-->    Speak to me.  
line 24133-->    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
line 24134-->    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
line 24135-->    O, speak!
line 24136-->    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
line 24137-->    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
line 24138-->    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
line 24139-->                                                 The cock crows.
line 24140-->    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
line 24141-->  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
line 24142-->  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
line 24143-->  Ber. 'Tis here!
line 24144-->  Hor. 'Tis here!
line 24145-->  Mar. 'Tis gone!
line 24146-->                                                     Exit Ghost.
line 24147-->    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
line 24148-->    To offer it the show of violence;
line 24149-->    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
line 24150-->    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
line 24151-->  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
line 24152-->  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
line 24153-->    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
line 24154-->    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
line 24155-->    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
line 24156-->    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
line 24157-->    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
line 24158-->    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
line 24159-->    To his confine; and of the truth herein
line 24160-->    This present object made probation.
line 24161-->  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
line 24162-->    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
line 24163-->    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
line 24164-->    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
line 24165-->    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
line 24166-->    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
line 24167-->    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
line 24168-->    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
line 24169-->  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
line 24170-->    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
line 24171-->    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
line 24172-->    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
line 24173-->    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
line 24174-->    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
line 24175-->    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
line 24176-->    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
line 24177-->    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
line 24178-->    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
line 24179-->    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
line 24180-->
line 24181-->
line 24182-->
line 24183-->
line 24184-->Scene II.
line 24185-->Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
line 24186-->
line 24187-->Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
line 24188-->Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
line 24189-->Lords Attendant.
line 24190-->
line 24191-->  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
line 24192-->    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
line 24193-->    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
line 24194-->    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
line 24195-->    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
line 24196-->    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
line 24197-->    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
line 24198-->    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
line 24199-->    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
line 24200-->    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
line 24201-->    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
line 24202-->    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
line 24203-->    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
line 24204-->    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
line 24205-->    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
line 24206-->    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
line 24207-->    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
line 24208-->    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
line 24209-->    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
line 24210-->    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
line 24211-->    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
line 24212-->    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
line 24213-->    Importing the surrender of those lands
line 24214-->    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
line 24215-->    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
line 24216-->    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
line 24217-->    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
line 24218-->    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
line 24219-->    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
line 24220-->    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
line 24221-->    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
line 24222-->    The lists, and full proportions are all made
line 24223-->    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
line 24224-->    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
line 24225-->    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
line 24226-->    Giving to you no further personal power
line 24227-->    To business with the King, more than the scope
line 24228-->    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
line 24229-->    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
line 24230-->  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
line 24231-->  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
line 24232-->                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
line 24233-->    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
line 24234-->    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
line 24235-->    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
line 24236-->    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
line 24237-->    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
line 24238-->    The head is not more native to the heart,
line 24239-->    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
line 24240-->    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
line 24241-->    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
line 24242-->  Laer. My dread lord,
line 24243-->    Your leave and favour to return to France;
line 24244-->    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
line 24245-->    To show my duty in your coronation,  
line 24246-->    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
line 24247-->    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
line 24248-->    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
line 24249-->  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
line 24250-->  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
line 24251-->    By laboursome petition, and at last
line 24252-->    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
line 24253-->    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
line 24254-->  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
line 24255-->    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
line 24256-->    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
line 24257-->  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
line 24258-->  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
line 24259-->  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
line 24260-->  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
line 24261-->    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
line 24262-->    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
line 24263-->    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
line 24264-->    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
line 24265-->    Passing through nature to eternity.  
line 24266-->  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
line 24267-->  Queen. If it be,
line 24268-->    Why seems it so particular with thee?
line 24269-->  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
line 24270-->    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
line 24271-->    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
line 24272-->    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
line 24273-->    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
line 24274-->    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
line 24275-->    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
line 24276-->    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
line 24277-->    For they are actions that a man might play;
line 24278-->    But I have that within which passeth show-
line 24279-->    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
line 24280-->  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
line 24281-->    To give these mourning duties to your father;
line 24282-->    But you must know, your father lost a father;
line 24283-->    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
line 24284-->    In filial obligation for some term
line 24285-->    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
line 24286-->    In obstinate condolement is a course
line 24287-->    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
line 24288-->    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
line 24289-->    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
line 24290-->    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
line 24291-->    For what we know must be, and is as common
line 24292-->    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
line 24293-->    Why should we in our peevish opposition
line 24294-->    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
line 24295-->    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
line 24296-->    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
line 24297-->    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
line 24298-->    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
line 24299-->    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
line 24300-->    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
line 24301-->    As of a father; for let the world take note
line 24302-->    You are the most immediate to our throne,
line 24303-->    And with no less nobility of love
line 24304-->    Than that which dearest father bears his son
line 24305-->    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
line 24306-->    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
line 24307-->    It is most retrograde to our desire;
line 24308-->    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
line 24309-->    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
line 24310-->    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
line 24311-->  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
line 24312-->    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
line 24313-->  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
line 24314-->  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
line 24315-->    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
line 24316-->    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
line 24317-->    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
line 24318-->    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
line 24319-->    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
line 24320-->    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
line 24321-->    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
line 24322-->                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
line 24323-->  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
line 24324-->    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
line 24325-->    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
line 24326-->    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
line 24327-->    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
line 24328-->    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
line 24329-->    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
line 24330-->    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
line 24331-->    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
line 24332-->    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
line 24333-->    So excellent a king, that was to this
line 24334-->    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
line 24335-->    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
line 24336-->    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
line 24337-->    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
line 24338-->    As if increase of appetite had grown
line 24339-->    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
line 24340-->    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
line 24341-->    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
line 24342-->    With which she followed my poor father's body
line 24343-->    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
line 24344-->    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
line 24345-->    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
line 24346-->    My father's brother, but no more like my father
line 24347-->    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
line 24348-->    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
line 24349-->    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
line 24350-->    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
line 24351-->    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
line 24352-->    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
line 24353-->    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
line 24354-->
line 24355-->          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.
line 24356-->
line 24357-->  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
line 24358-->  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
line 24359-->    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
line 24360-->  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
line 24361-->  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
line 24362-->    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
line 24363-->    Marcellus?
line 24364-->  Mar. My good lord!
line 24365-->  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
line 24366-->    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
line 24367-->  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
line 24368-->  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
line 24369-->    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
line 24370-->    To make it truster of your own report
line 24371-->    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
line 24372-->    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
line 24373-->    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
line 24374-->  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
line 24375-->  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
line 24376-->    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
line 24377-->  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
line 24378-->  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
line 24379-->    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
line 24380-->    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
line 24381-->    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
line 24382-->    My father- methinks I see my father.
line 24383-->  Hor. O, where, my lord?
line 24384-->  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
line 24385-->  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
line 24386-->  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
line 24387-->    I shall not look upon his like again.
line 24388-->  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
line 24389-->  Ham. Saw? who?
line 24390-->  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
line 24391-->  Ham. The King my father?
line 24392-->  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
line 24393-->    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
line 24394-->    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
line 24395-->    This marvel to you.
line 24396-->  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
line 24397-->  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
line 24398-->    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
line 24399-->    In the dead vast and middle of the night
line 24400-->    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
line 24401-->    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
line 24402-->    Appears before them and with solemn march
line 24403-->    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
line 24404-->    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
line 24405-->    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
line 24406-->    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
line 24407-->    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
line 24408-->    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
line 24409-->    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
line 24410-->    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
line 24411-->    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
line 24412-->    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
line 24413-->    These hands are not more like.
line 24414-->  Ham. But where was this?
line 24415-->  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
line 24416-->  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
line 24417-->  Hor. My lord, I did;
line 24418-->    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
line 24419-->    It lifted up it head and did address
line 24420-->    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
line 24421-->    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
line 24422-->    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
line 24423-->    And vanish'd from our sight.
line 24424-->  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
line 24425-->  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
line 24426-->    And we did think it writ down in our duty
line 24427-->    To let you know of it.
line 24428-->  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
line 24429-->    Hold you the watch to-night?
line 24430-->  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
line 24431-->  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
line 24432-->  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
line 24433-->  Ham. From top to toe?
line 24434-->  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
line 24435-->  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
line 24436-->  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
line 24437-->  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
line 24438-->  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
line 24439-->  Ham. Pale or red?
line 24440-->  Hor. Nay, very pale.
line 24441-->  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
line 24442-->  Hor. Most constantly.
line 24443-->  Ham. I would I had been there.
line 24444-->  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
line 24445-->  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
line 24446-->  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
line 24447-->  Both. Longer, longer.
line 24448-->  Hor. Not when I saw't.
line 24449-->  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
line 24450-->  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
line 24451-->    A sable silver'd.
line 24452-->  Ham. I will watch to-night.
line 24453-->    Perchance 'twill walk again.
line 24454-->  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
line 24455-->  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
line 24456-->    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
line 24457-->    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
line 24458-->    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
line 24459-->    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
line 24460-->    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
line 24461-->    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
line 24462-->    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
line 24463-->    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
line 24464-->    I'll visit you.
line 24465-->  All. Our duty to your honour.  
line 24466-->  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
line 24467-->                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
line 24468-->    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
line 24469-->    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
line 24470-->    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
line 24471-->    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
line 24472-->Exit.
line 24473-->
line 24474-->
line 24475-->
line 24476-->
line 24477-->Scene III.
line 24478-->Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.
line 24479-->
line 24480-->Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
line 24481-->
line 24482-->  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
line 24483-->    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
line 24484-->    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
line 24485-->    But let me hear from you.
line 24486-->  Oph. Do you doubt that?
line 24487-->  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
line 24488-->    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
line 24489-->    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
line 24490-->    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
line 24491-->    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
line 24492-->    No more.
line 24493-->  Oph. No more but so?
line 24494-->  Laer. Think it no more.
line 24495-->    For nature crescent does not grow alone
line 24496-->    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
line 24497-->    The inward service of the mind and soul
line 24498-->    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
line 24499-->    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
line 24500-->    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
line 24501-->    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
line 24502-->    For he himself is subject to his birth.
line 24503-->    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
line 24504-->    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
line 24505-->    The safety and health of this whole state,
line 24506-->    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
line 24507-->    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
line 24508-->    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
line 24509-->    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
line 24510-->    As he in his particular act and place
line 24511-->    May give his saying deed; which is no further
line 24512-->    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
line 24513-->    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
line 24514-->    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
line 24515-->    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
line 24516-->    To his unmast'red importunity.
line 24517-->    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
line 24518-->    And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
line 24519-->    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
line 24520-->    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
line 24521-->    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
line 24522-->    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
line 24523-->    The canker galls the infants of the spring
line 24524-->    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
line 24525-->    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
line 24526-->    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
line 24527-->    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
line 24528-->    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
line 24529-->  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
line 24530-->    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
line 24531-->    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
line 24532-->    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
line 24533-->    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
line 24534-->    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
line 24535-->    And recks not his own rede.
line 24536-->  Laer. O, fear me not!
line 24537-->
line 24538-->                       Enter Polonius.  
line 24539-->
line 24540-->    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
line 24541-->    A double blessing is a double grace;
line 24542-->    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
line 24543-->  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
line 24544-->    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
line 24545-->    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
line 24546-->    And these few precepts in thy memory
line 24547-->    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
line 24548-->    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
line 24549-->    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
line 24550-->    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
line 24551-->    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
line 24552-->    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
line 24553-->    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
line 24554-->    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
line 24555-->    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
line 24556-->    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
line 24557-->    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
line 24558-->    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
line 24559-->    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
line 24560-->    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
line 24561-->    And they in France of the best rank and station
line 24562-->    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
line 24563-->    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
line 24564-->    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
line 24565-->    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
line 24566-->    This above all- to thine own self be true,
line 24567-->    And it must follow, as the night the day,
line 24568-->    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
line 24569-->    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
line 24570-->  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
line 24571-->  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
line 24572-->  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
line 24573-->    What I have said to you.
line 24574-->  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
line 24575-->    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
line 24576-->  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
line 24577-->  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
line 24578-->  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
line 24579-->  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
line 24580-->    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
line 24581-->    Given private time to you, and you yourself
line 24582-->    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
line 24583-->    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
line 24584-->    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
line 24585-->    You do not understand yourself so clearly
line 24586-->    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
line 24587-->    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
line 24588-->  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
line 24589-->    Of his affection to me.
line 24590-->  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
line 24591-->    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
line 24592-->    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
line 24593-->  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
line 24594-->  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
line 24595-->    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
line 24596-->    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
line 24597-->    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
line 24598-->    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
line 24599-->  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
line 24600-->    In honourable fashion.
line 24601-->  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
line 24602-->  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
line 24603-->    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
line 24604-->  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
line 24605-->    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
line 24606-->    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
line 24607-->    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
line 24608-->    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
line 24609-->    You must not take for fire. From this time
line 24610-->    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
line 24611-->    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
line 24612-->    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
line 24613-->    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
line 24614-->    And with a larger tether may he walk
line 24615-->    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
line 24616-->    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
line 24617-->    Not of that dye which their investments show,
line 24618-->    But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
line 24619-->    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
line 24620-->    The better to beguile. This is for all:
line 24621-->    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
line 24622-->    Have you so slander any moment leisure
line 24623-->    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
line 24624-->    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
line 24625-->  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
line 24626-->                                                         Exeunt.
line 24627-->
line 24628-->
line 24629-->
line 24630-->
line 24631-->Scene IV.
line 24632-->Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.
line 24633-->
line 24634-->Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.
line 24635-->
line 24636-->  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
line 24637-->  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
line 24638-->  Ham. What hour now?
line 24639-->  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
line 24640-->  Mar. No, it is struck.
line 24641-->  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
line 24642-->    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
line 24643-->                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
line 24644-->    What does this mean, my lord?
line 24645-->  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
line 24646-->    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
line 24647-->    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
line 24648-->    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
line 24649-->    The triumph of his pledge.
line 24650-->  Hor. Is it a custom?
line 24651-->  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
line 24652-->    But to my mind, though I am native here  
line 24653-->    And to the manner born, it is a custom
line 24654-->    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
line 24655-->    This heavy-headed revel east and west
line 24656-->    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
line 24657-->    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
line 24658-->    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
line 24659-->    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
line 24660-->    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
line 24661-->    So oft it chances in particular men
line 24662-->    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
line 24663-->    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
line 24664-->    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
line 24665-->    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
line 24666-->    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
line 24667-->    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
line 24668-->    The form of plausive manners, that these men
line 24669-->    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
line 24670-->    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
line 24671-->    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
line 24672-->    As infinite as man may undergo-  
line 24673-->    Shall in the general censure take corruption
line 24674-->    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
line 24675-->    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
line 24676-->
line 24677-->                         Enter Ghost.
line 24678-->
line 24679-->  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
line 24680-->  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
line 24681-->    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
line 24682-->    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
line 24683-->    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
line 24684-->    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
line 24685-->    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
line 24686-->    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
line 24687-->    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
line 24688-->    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
line 24689-->    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
line 24690-->    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
line 24691-->    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
line 24692-->    To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
line 24693-->    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
line 24694-->    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
line 24695-->    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
line 24696-->    So horridly to shake our disposition
line 24697-->    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
line 24698-->    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
line 24699-->                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
line 24700-->  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
line 24701-->    As if it some impartment did desire
line 24702-->    To you alone.
line 24703-->  Mar. Look with what courteous action
line 24704-->    It waves you to a more removed ground.
line 24705-->    But do not go with it!
line 24706-->  Hor. No, by no means!
line 24707-->  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
line 24708-->  Hor. Do not, my lord!
line 24709-->  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
line 24710-->    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
line 24711-->    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
line 24712-->    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
line 24713-->    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
line 24714-->  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
line 24715-->    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
line 24716-->    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
line 24717-->    And there assume some other, horrible form
line 24718-->    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
line 24719-->    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
line 24720-->    The very place puts toys of desperation,
line 24721-->    Without more motive, into every brain
line 24722-->    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
line 24723-->    And hears it roar beneath.
line 24724-->  Ham. It waves me still.
line 24725-->    Go on. I'll follow thee.
line 24726-->  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
line 24727-->  Ham. Hold off your hands!
line 24728-->  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
line 24729-->  Ham. My fate cries out
line 24730-->    And makes each petty artire in this body
line 24731-->    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
line 24732-->                                                [Ghost beckons.]  
line 24733-->    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
line 24734-->    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
line 24735-->    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
line 24736-->                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
line 24737-->  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
line 24738-->  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
line 24739-->  Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
line 24740-->  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
line 24741-->  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
line 24742-->  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
line 24743-->                                                         Exeunt.
line 24744-->
line 24745-->
line 24746-->
line 24747-->
line 24748-->Scene V.
line 24749-->Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.
line 24750-->
line 24751-->Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
line 24752-->
line 24753-->  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
line 24754-->  Ghost. Mark me.
line 24755-->  Ham. I will.
line 24756-->  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
line 24757-->    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
line 24758-->    Must render up myself.
line 24759-->  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
line 24760-->  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
line 24761-->    To what I shall unfold.
line 24762-->  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
line 24763-->  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
line 24764-->  Ham. What?
line 24765-->  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
line 24766-->    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
line 24767-->    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
line 24768-->    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
line 24769-->    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid  
line 24770-->    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
line 24771-->    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
line 24772-->    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
line 24773-->    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
line 24774-->    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
line 24775-->    And each particular hair to stand an end
line 24776-->    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
line 24777-->    But this eternal blazon must not be
line 24778-->    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
line 24779-->    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
line 24780-->  Ham. O God!
line 24781-->  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
line 24782-->  Ham. Murther?
line 24783-->  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
line 24784-->    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
line 24785-->  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
line 24786-->    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
line 24787-->    May sweep to my revenge.
line 24788-->  Ghost. I find thee apt;
line 24789-->    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
line 24790-->    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
line 24791-->    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
line 24792-->    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
line 24793-->    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
line 24794-->    Is by a forged process of my death
line 24795-->    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
line 24796-->    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
line 24797-->    Now wears his crown.
line 24798-->  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
line 24799-->    My uncle?
line 24800-->  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
line 24801-->    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
line 24802-->    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
line 24803-->    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
line 24804-->    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
line 24805-->    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
line 24806-->    From me, whose love was of that dignity
line 24807-->    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
line 24808-->    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
line 24809-->    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
line 24810-->    To those of mine!
line 24811-->    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
line 24812-->    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
line 24813-->    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
line 24814-->    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
line 24815-->    And prey on garbage.
line 24816-->    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
line 24817-->    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
line 24818-->    My custom always of the afternoon,
line 24819-->    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
line 24820-->    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
line 24821-->    And in the porches of my ears did pour
line 24822-->    The leperous distilment; whose effect
line 24823-->    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
line 24824-->    That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
line 24825-->    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
line 24826-->    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
line 24827-->    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
line 24828-->    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
line 24829-->    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
line 24830-->    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
line 24831-->    All my smooth body.
line 24832-->    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
line 24833-->    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
line 24834-->    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
line 24835-->    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
line 24836-->    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
line 24837-->    With all my imperfections on my head.
line 24838-->  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
line 24839-->  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
line 24840-->    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
line 24841-->    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
line 24842-->    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
line 24843-->    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
line 24844-->    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
line 24845-->    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
line 24846-->    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
line 24847-->    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
line 24848-->    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
line 24849-->    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.  
line 24850-->  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
line 24851-->    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
line 24852-->    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
line 24853-->    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
line 24854-->    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
line 24855-->    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
line 24856-->    Yea, from the table of my memory
line 24857-->    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
line 24858-->    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
line 24859-->    That youth and observation copied there,
line 24860-->    And thy commandment all alone shall live
line 24861-->    Within the book and volume of my brain,
line 24862-->    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
line 24863-->    O most pernicious woman!
line 24864-->    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
line 24865-->    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
line 24866-->    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
line 24867-->    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
line 24868-->    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
line 24869-->    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
line 24870-->    I have sworn't.
line 24871-->  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
line 24872-->
line 24873-->                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
line 24874-->
line 24875-->  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
line 24876-->  Hor. Heaven secure him!
line 24877-->  Ham. So be it!
line 24878-->  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
line 24879-->  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
line 24880-->  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
line 24881-->  Hor. What news, my lord?
line 24882-->  Mar. O, wonderful!
line 24883-->  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
line 24884-->  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
line 24885-->  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
line 24886-->  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
line 24887-->  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
line 24888-->    But you'll be secret?
line 24889-->  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
line 24890-->  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
line 24891-->    But he's an arrant knave.
line 24892-->  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
line 24893-->    To tell us this.
line 24894-->  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
line 24895-->    And so, without more circumstance at all,
line 24896-->    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
line 24897-->    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
line 24898-->    For every man hath business and desire,
line 24899-->    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
line 24900-->    Look you, I'll go pray.
line 24901-->  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
line 24902-->  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
line 24903-->    Yes, faith, heartily.
line 24904-->  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
line 24905-->  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
line 24906-->    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
line 24907-->    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
line 24908-->    For your desire to know what is between us,
line 24909-->    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
line 24910-->    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
line 24911-->    Give me one poor request.
line 24912-->  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
line 24913-->  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
line 24914-->  Both. My lord, we will not.
line 24915-->  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
line 24916-->  Hor. In faith,
line 24917-->    My lord, not I.
line 24918-->  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
line 24919-->  Ham. Upon my sword.
line 24920-->  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
line 24921-->  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
line 24922-->
line 24923-->                 Ghost cries under the stage.
line 24924-->
line 24925-->  Ghost. Swear.
line 24926-->  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
line 24927-->    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
line 24928-->    Consent to swear.
line 24929-->  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
line 24930-->  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
line 24931-->    Swear by my sword.
line 24932-->  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
line 24933-->  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
line 24934-->    Come hither, gentlemen,
line 24935-->    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
line 24936-->    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
line 24937-->    Swear by my sword.
line 24938-->  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
line 24939-->  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
line 24940-->    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
line 24941-->  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
line 24942-->  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
line 24943-->    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
line 24944-->    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
line 24945-->    But come!
line 24946-->    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
line 24947-->    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
line 24948-->    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
line 24949-->    To put an antic disposition on),  
line 24950-->    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
line 24951-->    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
line 24952-->    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
line 24953-->    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
line 24954-->    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
line 24955-->    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
line 24956-->    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
line 24957-->    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
line 24958-->    Swear.
line 24959-->  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
line 24960-->                                                   [They swear.]
line 24961-->  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
line 24962-->    With all my love I do commend me to you;
line 24963-->    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
line 24964-->    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
line 24965-->    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
line 24966-->    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
line 24967-->    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
line 24968-->    That ever I was born to set it right!
line 24969-->    Nay, come, let's go together.  
line 24970-->                                                         Exeunt.

line 24985-->
line 24986-->Act II. Scene I.
line 24987-->Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.
line 24988-->
line 24989-->Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.
line 24990-->
line 24991-->  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
line 24992-->  Rey. I will, my lord.
line 24993-->  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
line 24994-->    Before You visit him, to make inquire
line 24995-->    Of his behaviour.
line 24996-->  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
line 24997-->  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
line 24998-->    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
line 24999-->    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
line 25000-->    What company, at what expense; and finding
line 25001-->    By this encompassment and drift of question
line 25002-->    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
line 25003-->    Than your particular demands will touch it.
line 25004-->    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
line 25005-->    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
line 25006-->    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
line 25007-->  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
line 25008-->  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
line 25009-->    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
line 25010-->    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
line 25011-->    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
line 25012-->    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
line 25013-->    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
line 25014-->    As are companions noted and most known
line 25015-->    To youth and liberty.
line 25016-->  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
line 25017-->  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
line 25018-->    Drabbing. You may go so far.
line 25019-->  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
line 25020-->  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
line 25021-->    You must not put another scandal on him,
line 25022-->    That he is open to incontinency.
line 25023-->    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
line 25024-->    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
line 25025-->    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
line 25026-->    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
line 25027-->    Of general assault.  
line 25028-->  Rey. But, my good lord-
line 25029-->  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
line 25030-->  Rey. Ay, my lord,
line 25031-->    I would know that.
line 25032-->  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
line 25033-->    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
line 25034-->    You laying these slight sullies on my son
line 25035-->    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
line 25036-->    Mark you,
line 25037-->    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
line 25038-->    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
line 25039-->    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
line 25040-->    He closes with you in this consequence:
line 25041-->    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
line 25042-->    According to the phrase or the addition
line 25043-->    Of man and country-
line 25044-->  Rey. Very good, my lord.
line 25045-->  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
line 25046-->    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
line 25047-->  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
line 25048-->    gentleman.'
line 25049-->  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
line 25050-->    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
line 25051-->    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
line 25052-->    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
line 25053-->    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
line 25054-->    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
line 25055-->    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
line 25056-->    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
line 25057-->    See you now-
line 25058-->    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
line 25059-->    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
line 25060-->    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
line 25061-->    By indirections find directions out.
line 25062-->    So, by my former lecture and advice,
line 25063-->    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
line 25064-->  Rey. My lord, I have.
line 25065-->  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
line 25066-->  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
line 25067-->  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
line 25068-->  Rey. I shall, my lord.
line 25069-->  Pol. And let him ply his music.
line 25070-->  Rey. Well, my lord.
line 25071-->  Pol. Farewell!
line 25072-->                                                  Exit Reynaldo.
line 25073-->
line 25074-->                       Enter Ophelia.
line 25075-->
line 25076-->    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
line 25077-->  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
line 25078-->  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
line 25079-->  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
line 25080-->    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
line 25081-->    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
line 25082-->    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
line 25083-->    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
line 25084-->    And with a look so piteous in purport
line 25085-->    As if he had been loosed out of hell
line 25086-->    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
line 25087-->  Pol. Mad for thy love?  
line 25088-->  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
line 25089-->    But truly I do fear it.
line 25090-->  Pol. What said he?
line 25091-->  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
line 25092-->    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
line 25093-->    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
line 25094-->    He falls to such perusal of my face
line 25095-->    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
line 25096-->    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
line 25097-->    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
line 25098-->    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
line 25099-->    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
line 25100-->    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
line 25101-->    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
line 25102-->    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
line 25103-->    For out o' doors he went without their help
line 25104-->    And to the last bended their light on me.
line 25105-->  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
line 25106-->    This is the very ecstasy of love,
line 25107-->    Whose violent property fordoes itself  
line 25108-->    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
line 25109-->    As oft as any passion under heaven
line 25110-->    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
line 25111-->    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
line 25112-->  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
line 25113-->    I did repel his letters and denied
line 25114-->    His access to me.
line 25115-->  Pol. That hath made him mad.
line 25116-->    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
line 25117-->    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
line 25118-->    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
line 25119-->    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
line 25120-->    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
line 25121-->    As it is common for the younger sort
line 25122-->    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
line 25123-->    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
line 25124-->    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
line 25125-->    Come.
line 25126-->                                                         Exeunt.
line 25127-->
line 25128-->Scene II.
line 25129-->Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
line 25130-->
line 25131-->Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, cum aliis.
line 25132-->
line 25133-->  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
line 25134-->    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
line 25135-->    The need we have to use you did provoke
line 25136-->    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
line 25137-->    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
line 25138-->    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
line 25139-->    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
line 25140-->    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
line 25141-->    So much from th' understanding of himself,
line 25142-->    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
line 25143-->    That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
line 25144-->    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
line 25145-->    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
line 25146-->    Some little time; so by your companies
line 25147-->    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
line 25148-->    So much as from occasion you may glean,  
line 25149-->    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
line 25150-->    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
line 25151-->  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
line 25152-->    And sure I am two men there are not living
line 25153-->    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
line 25154-->    To show us so much gentry and good will
line 25155-->    As to expend your time with us awhile
line 25156-->    For the supply and profit of our hope,
line 25157-->    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
line 25158-->    As fits a king's remembrance.
line 25159-->  Ros. Both your Majesties
line 25160-->    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
line 25161-->    Put your dread pleasures more into command
line 25162-->    Than to entreaty.
line 25163-->  Guil. But we both obey,
line 25164-->    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
line 25165-->    To lay our service freely at your feet,
line 25166-->    To be commanded.
line 25167-->  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
line 25168-->  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
line 25169-->    And I beseech you instantly to visit
line 25170-->    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
line 25171-->    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
line 25172-->  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
line 25173-->    Pleasant and helpful to him!
line 25174-->  Queen. Ay, amen!
line 25175-->                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
line 25176-->                                                    Attendants].
line 25177-->
line 25178-->                         Enter Polonius.
line 25179-->
line 25180-->  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
line 25181-->    Are joyfully return'd.
line 25182-->  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
line 25183-->  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
line 25184-->    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
line 25185-->    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
line 25186-->    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
line 25187-->    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
line 25188-->    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
line 25189-->    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
line 25190-->  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
line 25191-->  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
line 25192-->    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
line 25193-->  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
line 25194-->                                                [Exit Polonius.]
line 25195-->    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
line 25196-->    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
line 25197-->  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
line 25198-->    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
line 25199-->  King. Well, we shall sift him.
line 25200-->
line 25201-->              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.
line 25202-->
line 25203-->    Welcome, my good friends.
line 25204-->    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
line 25205-->  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
line 25206-->    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
line 25207-->    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
line 25208-->    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
line 25209-->    But better look'd into, he truly found
line 25210-->    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
line 25211-->    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
line 25212-->    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
line 25213-->    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
line 25214-->    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
line 25215-->    Makes vow before his uncle never more
line 25216-->    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
line 25217-->    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
line 25218-->    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
line 25219-->    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
line 25220-->    So levied as before, against the Polack;
line 25221-->    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
line 25222-->                                                [Gives a paper.]
line 25223-->    That it might please you to give quiet pass
line 25224-->    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
line 25225-->    On such regards of safety and allowance
line 25226-->    As therein are set down.
line 25227-->  King. It likes us well;
line 25228-->    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
line 25229-->    Answer, and think upon this business.
line 25230-->    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
line 25231-->    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
line 25232-->    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
line 25233-->  Pol. This business is well ended.
line 25234-->    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
line 25235-->    What majesty should be, what duty is,
line 25236-->    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
line 25237-->    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
line 25238-->    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
line 25239-->    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
line 25240-->    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
line 25241-->    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
line 25242-->    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
line 25243-->    But let that go.
line 25244-->  Queen. More matter, with less art.
line 25245-->  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
line 25246-->    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
line 25247-->    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
line 25248-->    But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
line 25249-->    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
line 25250-->    That we find out the cause of this effect-
line 25251-->    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
line 25252-->    For this effect defective comes by cause.
line 25253-->    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
line 25254-->    Perpend.
line 25255-->    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
line 25256-->    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
line 25257-->    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
line 25258-->                                             [Reads] the letter.
line 25259-->    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
line 25260-->      Ophelia,'-
line 25261-->
line 25262-->    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
line 25263-->      phrase.
line 25264-->    But you shall hear. Thus:
line 25265-->                                                        [Reads.]
line 25266-->    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
line 25267-->  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
line 25268-->  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]  
line 25269-->
line 25270-->          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
line 25271-->            Doubt that the sun doth move;
line 25272-->          Doubt truth to be a liar;
line 25273-->            But never doubt I love.
line 25274-->      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
line 25275-->    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
line 25276-->    it. Adieu.
line 25277-->      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
line 25278-->                                                          HAMLET.'
line 25279-->
line 25280-->    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
line 25281-->    And more above, hath his solicitings,
line 25282-->    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
line 25283-->    All given to mine ear.
line 25284-->  King. But how hath she
line 25285-->    Receiv'd his love?
line 25286-->  Pol. What do you think of me?
line 25287-->  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
line 25288-->  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
line 25289-->    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
line 25290-->    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
line 25291-->    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
line 25292-->    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
line 25293-->    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
line 25294-->    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
line 25295-->    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
line 25296-->    What might you think? No, I went round to work
line 25297-->    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
line 25298-->    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
line 25299-->    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
line 25300-->    That she should lock herself from his resort,
line 25301-->    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
line 25302-->    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
line 25303-->    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
line 25304-->    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
line 25305-->    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
line 25306-->    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
line 25307-->    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
line 25308-->    And all we mourn for.  
line 25309-->  King. Do you think 'tis this?
line 25310-->  Queen. it may be, very like.
line 25311-->  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
line 25312-->    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
line 25313-->    When it prov'd otherwise.?
line 25314-->  King. Not that I know.
line 25315-->  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
line 25316-->      be otherwise.
line 25317-->    If circumstances lead me, I will find
line 25318-->    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
line 25319-->    Within the centre.
line 25320-->  King. How may we try it further?
line 25321-->  Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
line 25322-->    Here in the lobby.
line 25323-->  Queen. So he does indeed.
line 25324-->  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
line 25325-->    Be you and I behind an arras then.
line 25326-->    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
line 25327-->    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
line 25328-->    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
line 25329-->    But keep a farm and carters.
line 25330-->  King. We will try it.
line 25331-->
line 25332-->                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.
line 25333-->
line 25334-->  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
line 25335-->  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
line 25336-->    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
line 25337-->                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
line 25338-->    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
line 25339-->  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
line 25340-->  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
line 25341-->  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
line 25342-->  Pol. Not I, my lord.
line 25343-->  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
line 25344-->  Pol. Honest, my lord?
line 25345-->  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
line 25346-->    pick'd out of ten thousand.
line 25347-->  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
line 25348-->  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
line 25349-->    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
line 25350-->  Pol. I have, my lord.
line 25351-->  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
line 25352-->    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
line 25353-->  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
line 25354-->    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
line 25355-->    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
line 25356-->    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
line 25357-->    read, my lord?
line 25358-->  Ham. Words, words, words.
line 25359-->  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
line 25360-->  Ham. Between who?
line 25361-->  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
line 25362-->  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
line 25363-->    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
line 25364-->    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
line 25365-->    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
line 25366-->    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
line 25367-->    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
line 25368-->    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  
line 25369-->  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
line 25370-->   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
line 25371-->  Ham. Into my grave?
line 25372-->  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
line 25373-->    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
line 25374-->    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
line 25375-->    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
line 25376-->    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
line 25377-->    my leave of you.
line 25378-->  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
line 25379-->    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
line 25380-->    life,
line 25381-->
line 25382-->                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
line 25383-->
line 25384-->  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
line 25385-->  Ham. These tedious old fools!
line 25386-->  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
line 25387-->  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
line 25388-->                                                Exit [Polonius].  
line 25389-->  Guil. My honour'd lord!
line 25390-->  Ros. My most dear lord!
line 25391-->  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
line 25392-->    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
line 25393-->  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
line 25394-->  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
line 25395-->    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
line 25396-->  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
line 25397-->  Ros. Neither, my lord.
line 25398-->  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
line 25399-->    favours?
line 25400-->  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
line 25401-->  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
line 25402-->    strumpet. What news ?
line 25403-->  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
line 25404-->  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
line 25405-->    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
line 25406-->    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
line 25407-->    hither?
line 25408-->  Guil. Prison, my lord?  
line 25409-->  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
line 25410-->  Ros. Then is the world one.
line 25411-->  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
line 25412-->    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
line 25413-->  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
line 25414-->  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
line 25415-->    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
line 25416-->  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
line 25417-->    mind.
line 25418-->  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
line 25419-->    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
line 25420-->  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
line 25421-->    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
line 25422-->  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
line 25423-->  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
line 25424-->    it is but a shadow's shadow.
line 25425-->  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
line 25426-->    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
line 25427-->    fay, I cannot reason.
line 25428-->  Both. We'll wait upon you.  
line 25429-->  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
line 25430-->    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
line 25431-->    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
line 25432-->    make you at Elsinore?
line 25433-->  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
line 25434-->  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
line 25435-->    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
line 25436-->    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
line 25437-->    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
line 25438-->  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
line 25439-->  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
line 25440-->    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
line 25441-->    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
line 25442-->    have sent for you.
line 25443-->  Ros. To what end, my lord?
line 25444-->  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
line 25445-->    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
line 25446-->    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
line 25447-->    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
line 25448-->    me, whether you were sent for or no.  
line 25449-->  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
line 25450-->  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
line 25451-->    not off.
line 25452-->  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
line 25453-->  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
line 25454-->    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
line 25455-->    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
line 25456-->    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
line 25457-->    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
line 25458-->    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
line 25459-->    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
line 25460-->    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
line 25461-->    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
line 25462-->    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
line 25463-->    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
line 25464-->    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
line 25465-->    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
line 25466-->    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
line 25467-->    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
line 25468-->  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
line 25469-->  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
line 25470-->  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
line 25471-->    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
line 25472-->    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
line 25473-->  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
line 25474-->    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
line 25475-->    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
line 25476-->    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
line 25477-->    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
line 25478-->    freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
line 25479-->    they?
line 25480-->  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
line 25481-->    tragedians of the city.
line 25482-->  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
line 25483-->    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
line 25484-->  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
line 25485-->    innovation.
line 25486-->  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
line 25487-->    city? Are they so follow'd?
line 25488-->  Ros. No indeed are they not.  
line 25489-->  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
line 25490-->  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
line 25491-->    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
line 25492-->    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
line 25493-->    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
line 25494-->    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
line 25495-->    dare scarce come thither.
line 25496-->  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
line 25497-->    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
line 25498-->    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
line 25499-->    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
line 25500-->    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
line 25501-->    against their own succession.
line 25502-->  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
line 25503-->    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
line 25504-->    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
line 25505-->    went to cuffs in the question.
line 25506-->  Ham. Is't possible?
line 25507-->  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
line 25508-->  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
line 25509-->  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
line 25510-->  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
line 25511-->    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
line 25512-->    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
line 25513-->    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
line 25514-->    philosophy could find it out.
line 25515-->
line 25516-->                     Flourish for the Players.
line 25517-->
line 25518-->  Guil. There are the players.
line 25519-->  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
line 25520-->    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
line 25521-->    with you in this garb,
